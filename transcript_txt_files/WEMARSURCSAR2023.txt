mobile Advanced robotics Society or
weedmars for short a team of dedicated
engineering students from different
backgrounds have different experiences
our design is a six wheel rocker Pokey
system in order to have more flexibility
and mobility in rougher terrain the
wheels Happy chose it to be compact
durable and high friction using built-in
Motors so that there won't be any
external Motors exposed to the elements
while having rubber Wheels in order to
have enough friction to maneuver around
designed to be compact strong and
modular so that different parts can put
in and Replacements are very easily
implemented into the system
the frames are constructed using resin
cast carbon fiber in order to increase
strength and resistance
finally in order to ensure that our
delicate parts of our system are
protected we use Apollo chassis in order
to be able to thread any and all wires
throughout the Rover
or increase maintainability and
Effectiveness we've decided to go for a
decentralized architecture for our
electrical system
a Raspberry Pi was selected as the
primary controller as it is high in
processing ability easy to use and is
very robust
using esp32 my controllers we are able
to control many different pistols such
as cameras GPS system inertia
measurements and Battery management
for the power of battery management
system we use a Lithium Polymer battery
of 10 000 milliamps and a monitoring
chip consisting of Texas Instruments
brand this allows us to check the state
of charge battery health temperature
voltage and current discharge rate
by having these information we are able
to ensure that our battery and power
system is functioning well
these information are also connected
back to the Raspberry Pi
finally we have chosen the esp32 cameras
in order to allow for our operators to
have a good sense of their surrounding
without sacrificing too much on
processing power and increasing too much
load on our system in order to improve
the quality of life of our operators and
to show that they have enough
information to Traverse the terrain
safely we used GPS tracking through
Google Maps API and pubnub live location
to produce a live location of the Rover
on the map
the GPS module on or Rover will
communicate to the Raspberry Pi and pass
on the information needed onto the
localized mobile Mission Control
ARP ladder sensor is used in order to
allow for our operators to have a top 10
view of any potential obstacle this is
done by having several benchmarks
created beforehand in order to allow our
Rover to have the necessary knowledge to
understand what is and what is it a
potential obstacle these are all taken
from the Royal Oak Peak Arduino Library
thank you for watching this video we're
looking forward to going to the URC this
year
we all hope you have a wonderful day
