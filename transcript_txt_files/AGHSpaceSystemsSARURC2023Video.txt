Hello, we are AGH Space Systems from the AGH university in Kraków, Poland.
We are a team of 34 students from various fields of study, from robotics and computer science, up to chemistry and geology
We are divided into 4 sub teams: mechanics, electronics, software and science
Today, we would like to present an effect of over 5 years of development
the planetary rover Kalman
Our key design rule is high modularity
This allows for iterative development and replacing entire subsystems, without suspending the rover’s operability
The drive system is based on a rocker suspension and 4 independently turned and propelled wheels
This allows us to drive sideways, diagonally and even turn in place
This year we’re building a new, lighter suspension and more powerful propulsion modules
to complement the 40% lighter and more spacious frame developed last year
We have also developed a new iteration of 3D printed wheels, saving 3 kg
and continue to work on improving their design
The rover’s arm is a product of over 2 years of development
It features 6 degrees of freedom, BLDC motors and a decentralized controller
IK algorithms and predefined trajectories make it fast to carry out tasks
Last year we focused on improving its reliability and developing a modular gripper
It houses 3 perpendicular cameras and allows us to easily change claws for different missions
or attach extensions, such as the macro camera for the Science Mission
Good serviceability is one of our main design goals
Batteries quickly slide in and out of 3D printed mountings outside the frame
The arm is connected with just 4 screws and 2 cables
Last year we even redesigned all crucial PCBs to have the same physical size
Now they slide right into a single, 3D printed box
Replacing PCBs for different missions or in case of failure has never been faster
All of this allows us to switch the robot's configuration between Maintenance and Autonomous missions in under 10 minutes
while staying under the 50 kg weight limit
The rover has been fitted with an easily accessible red emergency button
which physically breaks the connection to the batteries, completely and instantly shutting off power
Communication between the rover and the ground station is ensured by 433 MHz full-duplex RF modules
Video feedback is provided by a 5.8 GHz link
This has been tested to provide comfortable control over the rover on distances reaching 1 km, with minimum video delay
Our ground station application has been greatly improved over the last year
It now features live visualization of wheels and arm position
Localization of the robot is shown on a satellite map
Operators can quickly switch between several modes of steering the rover or access predefined arm trajectories
We use a classic gamepad for driving and a 3D manipulator for controlling the arm
Our autonomous system is based on ROS packages that were adjusted to outdoor environments
The localization algorithm is based on IMU and GPS RTK, which ensures up to 5 cm accuracy
Data from the sensors is then merged by Extended Kalman Filter
For mapping purposes, we use an IR based stereo camera, to generate a costmap
Fast and robust computer vision algorithms are used for detecting and localizing aruco tags
We test the autonomous traversal on bi-weekly basis in a variety of difficult, real-life environments
to make sure that our system works irrespective of terrain type or weather and lighting conditions
During Science Mission soil samples are collected with a dedicated scoop end-effector and placed in sealable containers
The arm movement is automated in order to save time
Soil solution is then prepared and exposed to a series of chemical tests
which can detect the presence of various biomarkers
To provide additional context of the sampling site, a wide-angle panorama is easily captured
thanks to the rover’s ability to turn in place
Chosen sample is placed in an additional container
The onboard lab are easily detachable to save mass during other missions
All of the rover’s subsystems have been thoroughly tested before integration
while regular test drives allow operators to perfect their skills well before finals in Utah
Each year we take part in numerous science fairs, to inspire future generations
Last fall, our rover was also displayed at the International Astronautical Congress in Paris
the biggest event of this kind
None of this would be possible without support from our University, Ministry of Education and Science and private sponsors
Thank you!
see you in space
