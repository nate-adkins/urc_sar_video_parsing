there's a
an international competition held in
utah every year where you build mars
rovers and you get to compete with other
schools we've never built an autonomous
rover from kansas before not just ku but
all the schools here in kansas
and i'm a rocket gal so i was
kind of iffy about it but uh it's really
great on me yeah we're in our first
prototype right now we're building
the chassis and the robotic arm and
we're hoping to start on the science
payload soon i work on the drive train
and some of the cad models that we need
to make to kind of mock up what the
rover would look like as in like a 3d
kind of computer space before we
actually you know fabricate all the
parts and manufacture it i know you when
you think of rover you'd probably think
purely of space but there's a lot of
biology computer science chemistry
involved when you're looking at all the
payloads and stuff we would like at
least the bare minimum of a rover by the
end of this year
just something that can drive around and
operate remote control our goal is to
compete by 2023
um summer
for with our first
probably second prototype probably fully
autonomous it's been a blast so far
getting to build an opportunity
that is so new especially here in kansas
it's definitely been a challenge to work
on something so fresh and new but also
an amazing opportunity i'm very lucky to
be a part of this group
we're going to build a mars rover which
i think is really cool so
