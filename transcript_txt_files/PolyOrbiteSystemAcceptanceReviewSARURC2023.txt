Hi !
We're PolyOrbite,
a Canadian team of engineering
students from Polytechnique Montreal.
We're happy to present to you our SAR.
It's our third iteration
of our Mars rover.
In our first iteration.
We came second place in the
Canadian Challenge.
In our second iteration, so last year,
we came first in our province.
This year
we're hoping to participate in the URC
so we can continue succeeding
internationally in the rover challenges.
Our team is composed of students
from 11 different engineering fields.
They work together
in order to create a new rover
that will succeed
in all the task of the URC.
So my team was responsible for ensuring
the proper integration
of all the components together.
So, we had to integrate the structural components
along with the power distribution
and with the control system
so that everything can work together.
On top of that,
it also needed to be modular
to attach to a robotic arm
or science experiment.
All of this had to work off
our new 24 volts design
with our custom batteries
made to be easily swapped in and out.
Last year we had many issues
at the Canadian competition
with the power distribution
and mainly our terminal,
which had too many screws
and that was really finicky.
And so this year
we designed our own integrating
proper power
distribution, monitoring and safety
such as fuses.
The responsibilities of the control team
this year were to improve
the autonomous driving of the robot.
In order to do this,
we worked on a new interface
which helped to visualize
better
the different sensors on the robot.
For example,
we improve the visualization
of the batteries, the cameras,
the GPS and encoders,
and also the input of the joysticks
in order to control the robot.
In order to improve this,
we took advantage
of the differential driving system
where each joystick controls
one side of the robot's wheels.
So we worked on the LIDAR
independently from the robot
and now all that is left
is to test it
while having it implemented
on the robot itself.
The structure team
is primarily responsible
for the primary
mechanical systems of our rover,
notably the structural integrity
and propulsion parts of it.
Well, this year
we implemented
new 3D printed wheels
with a double layer dampening system
that allows us to increase traction
when rolling
and also dissipate
amounts of energy
during high impact situations.
This year
we optimized the chassis of the rover,
so we managed to reduce the footprint
and thus the mass of the total rover.
We also added polycarbonate shell
that allows us to easily
access the electronic components
and also protect them from dust and wind.
Our rover is capable of climbing
hills up to 35 degrees
and traversing obstacles
are up to 52 centimeters in height.
With all of these improvements
and our classic rocker
bogie suspension system,
we are now better than ever
equipped to navigate
the difficult terrain to URC.
The robotic arms’ team
responsibility this year is to conceive
and manufacture
a new robotic arm of six axis,
seven motors, five kilograms payloads
and a one meter reach,
and having a gripper
that can adapt to the shapes
of the different objects
with their two fingers.
It has to produce it from A to Z
in all the fields necessary
as the electrical, software
and mechanical.
The science team’s
responsibility is to retrieve
multiple samples
from different soil types
and analyze them
to find life or determine
if the life was extant,
extinct or present.
This year we built the onboard essay
to be able
to analyze the samples on the rover,
whereas before
we always did it outside of the Rover
independently.
We also need to align certain components
that are underlined.
For example,
the drill isn't able to completely
drop its sample into the lab efficiently
so there is some optimization
to do there.
But other than that,
most components are ready for use.
At the moment,
we can take 12 samples for analysis
and 4 samples for further analysis
outside of the rover.
I'm extremely proud of my team
and everything they have accomplished.
I'm confident we can succeed in the URC
given that we participate.
Thank you for considering our application
and we hope to see you in May.
