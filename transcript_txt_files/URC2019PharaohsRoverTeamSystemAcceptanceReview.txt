The Pharaohs team of the Military Technical College consists of four groups
Mechanical group
Electrical group
Science group
and Management and Logistics group
We take into consideration the
team requirement skills and the members
development and their ability of doing
tasks, in the shown figures we see the
number of skills required from the team
member how he was, how he is
and the development of each member
We fabricated
our 17 kilogram chassis from five
millimeter Aluminum sheet, this is
designed to be assembled like Lego
without any welding depending on
interference of metal
The body is made of Aluminum frame covered with Artelon
Double sheet boogie is used to achieve high
strength per unit weight
depending on the area moment of inertia Theory
Wheels are centered under the boogie to eliminate torsional stress
and in-wheel motor mounting ensures its safety
simulation shows the rocker boogie with
torsional bar allow the rover to climb a
vertical distance of 40 centimeters and
drop 70 centimeters
Easy disassembly allows us to pack the rover
in a small package for easy transportation
Manufacturing is being done in our
colleges workshop using CNC water jet machine
Our six degree of freedom
robotic arm is a distinguished by being
lightweight, simple in design, easy to
manufacture and modular
it consists of small parts assembled in a way that
makes it reconfigurable to control its workspace
Our gripper is designed to be
adaptive in order to hold things with
different shapes and sizes
Rover control system consists of two
main subsystems, low level controller
which is connected directly to the
physical layer and high level control
which handles navigation and path
planning
While ROS integrates the two subsystems
For system wiring high power
is separated from
the low power for the safety of the system
a PCB is used to
connect between the micro-controller and motor drivers
For rover control a PID
controller is used to maintain rover
heading even in case of failure of any
of the motors
Control system is designed with fault tolerance consideration
which
enables bypassing some of its components
in case of failure at expense of some
functionalities
Our navigation process consists of global and local planning systems
the global planning system is used to estimate the distance
and the angle between the rover and the target
providing an output heading command for
the low PID heading controller
by shortest paths algorithm
while the local
system is used for avoiding the
obstacles by direction weighting
algorithm, since it finds the best
direction relative to the rover's
position, so it's independent to the error from the INS
Antenna tracking is used
to improve the communication range and
by testing we achieve the range of 1.5
kilometers with low latency
as for the control station we can control the rover
using any web-connected device
which provides flexible and rapid startup
and also provides the driver with feedback of entire system
we are currently
testing the Rovers capabilities to
achieve the competition tasks
Since all tests must be on board we
depended on experiments that change
the color of the reagents so we decided to
get our sample in the form of solution
starting with carbohydrates using
Benedict reagent
and Protein using  Biuret reagent
and starch using iodine
Our study of rocks gives us clear
indication about the existence of
current or extinct life
we are also using a variety of sensors like
conductivity, humidity, temperature, pH and moisture
Respecting non-spell policy our
science box is designed to allow us to
make a solution and disperse it in all
test tubes
and is also equipped with a mini microscope
