hello
we are the team roverova from vsb
technical university of ostrava we are
preparing our rover k3b4 for the
university rover challenge 2022
currently our team consists of eight
students with each student being
responsible for one subsystem
we have worked on this rover for a
couple of years and went through
multiple versions of the design
the rover's mobility system consists of
an undercarriage with a rigid rocker
suspension the four wheels have
integrated hub motors and the ability to
turn each one individually giving the
rover the ability to drive using several
configurations
our 3d printed tires help the wheels get
necessary traction and provide the rover
with impact mitigation
this along with the rocker suspension
gives the rover good driving
characteristics in terrain with
relatively high maximum velocity
multiple analog fpv cameras are used for
low latency feedback
those are complemented by ip cameras
that are high definition and capable of
four times optical zoom
the cameras along with real-time 3d
visualization provide good situational
awareness for the rover operators
the rover can be controlled with a 900
megahertz rc transmitter or over wi-fi
if a signal from the rc transmitter is
not available the rover automatically
switches to wifi thus providing control
system redundancy
the video from analog cameras is
transmitted over 5.8 gigahertz band
video from ip cameras and webcams is
transmitted over wi-fi
together these systems provide visual
feedback redundancy
therefore even if the system loses wi-fi
signal we can still drive the rover with
visual feedback
the rover is equipped with a 5 degrees
of freedom manipulator that can reach
the ground on three sides of the rover
which gives it versatility in terrain
it can grasp and carry objects of
various sizes weighting up to 5
kilograms and pull heavier objects
we have implemented three ways to
control the manipulator
a direct teleoperation joystick that can
be used to intuitively control the arm
with one hand
automated mode can drive the manipulator
to saved positions
or we can switch to an inverse
kinematics mode for precise control
the arm is capable of pressing buttons
operating switches inserting plugs
opening drawers and more
the autonomous navigation program uses a
gps for global navigation and a z2
camera for local obstacle avoidance
two cameras with optical zoom are
mounted on the chassis for visual tag
detection with these cameras the rover
can detect goal posts and gates up to 12
meters away
we are testing the navigation system in
dynamic simulations and planned to test
in real environments soon

for the science task our team is
preparing a laboratory module for sample
analysis
the module will perform four tests which
will prove the presence of elements
important for the origin of life and
other essential compounds
after the tests are done we will be able
to tell whether there is life in the
sample or if there was life or if the
necessary compounds for life are present
this is the first generation of our
laboratory module and we are developing
it as a rotating carousel a robotic arm
scoops up the sample and places it in
the lab module the lab has a volumetric
hopper that allows the correct amount of
sample material to enter the reaction
the access material taken is then
removed from the lab module
due to the rotational layout of the
laboratory the operations we need can be
performed on three samples using one
sensory suite

our team may be small but our visions
are big
