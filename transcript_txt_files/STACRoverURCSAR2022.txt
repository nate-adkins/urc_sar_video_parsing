hello my name is michael sanchez and i
am the team lead for the rover project
at space technologies at cal
this year our team consists of 16
members whose majors range from
mechanical engineering and computer
science to biology and physics
given that this is stack's first time
participating in the university rover
challenge and that we did not previously
have a physical rover
our main focus since last semester has
been the rapid design and prototyping of
a thoughtfully engineered rover that we
feel will be fit for the field test
while so early in the integration
process we have begun the progress of
testing many of our mission critical
components and have been developing the
control and command system while waiting
for the rest of our parts to arrive
our first iteration is a scaled down
version of our rover which allows us to
develop the controls needed for the
extreme retrieval and autonomous
navigation missions
our next iteration will include the
fully machined body and proper
suspension system hi i'm ritu parmesh a
sophomore studying electrical
engineering and computer science i'm the
team software lead and we have been
working on implementing controls for the
rover and autonomous navigation using
simultaneous localization and mapping
algorithms
our current design of the control system
sends the user input either through a
joystick or keyboard control
to a microprocessor and converts it to
motor commands for the robotic arm and
drive motors it also transmits the
camera view back to the operator so that
they can see their surroundings while
driving remotely
the rover uses pid control loops for
precise movement and error adjustment as
well as an inverse kinematics framework
for operating the 4 degrees of freedom
robotic arm
our autonomous navigation uses an
extended kalman filter that combines
input from the gps imu
wheel encoders and stereo camera to
perform slant
we test our controls and navigation
algorithms in the simulator and we'll
continue to test
our code
my name is sean assar i am the
mechanical lead for ai rover at space
technologies at cal
and how we have prepared for this
competition is by taking the mission and
objectives for this challenge and
basically reverse engineering to create
the most optimal design for the job
we have designed a rocker bogey system
that acts as the main suspension
for the rover while keeping the dynamic
movements of the chassis at an all-time
low
speaking of the chassis we use 5052
aluminum to create a lightweight yet
strong body to house our components
the arm was designed
with carbon fiber to pick up objects up
to five kilograms while not tipping the
rover or compromising the mission and
our wheels are a flexible honeycomb
design that are going to be 3d printed
at jacobs hall
and in essence they're going to act as a
second suspension system because they're
going to absorb some of the shock along
with the rocker bowie suspension here we
have a cat drawing of the chassis
and as you can see the triangular
cutouts
as we talked about in the
report so these are there to pretty much
cut weight off
along with aesthetics
along with
cooling
of any hardware components that are
housed inside
and this top plate
also comes off and it's also covered um
on this side
here is the rocker bogey suspension so
three wheels will be
um mounted on this and this is one of
two so in total six wheels
and this will act as the suspension
here is the
housing for the camera module
we actually have this 3d printed
and in our prototype
and then here is the wheel now the
honeycomb design
once again will act as a second
suspension
