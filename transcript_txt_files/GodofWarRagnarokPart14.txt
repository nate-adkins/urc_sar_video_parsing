top of the morning ladies my name is
Jacksepticeye and welcome back to Dad of
boy I had to restart my PlayStation and
now they're just telling all of this
stuff again I don't care about you
getting high off the herbs okay war
table family assemble plan of attack
what are we doing
I want to know everything that's going
on I have cool armor I have a gatherhorn
you really did it
wow and all the nine realms you managed
to kill Heimdall I knew our spear would
do the trick
well happy Ragnarok everybody let's
drink
true
I'm doll's dead yup I can't believe it
believe it baby there's no stopping it
now
Odin swore peace only so long as you
spilled no more Acer blood
I refuse that deal
yet he honored it
but now
but what
you and I know better than anyone that
Odin's promises never last
we have the advantage who say do you
want here it's time to bring him down no
none of you understand what's coming
Odin's Vengeance will be his only
concern
not his only concern
the mask
whatever knowledge it unlocks that's
what Odin wants more than anything
if I go back to Asgard
go back
look
if I can finish what I started there
awaken the mask get answers
maybe that's our way out of this
but I gotta go soon
before they figure out what's happened
you are home
do not ask me to put you at risk again
he's at risk where he stands Kratos
we all are
anything we do or don't do is dangerous
right now
but Odin needs me
trust me
I'll be safe there
I don't know about all that
from a tactical perspective
am I wrong I don't much like it but it
is our best play
dividing Odin's Focus would buy us time
and give us a pair of eyes in the
enemies intersect him but
if there is truly a source of infinite
knowledge
and once he has what he needs from you
then I lose my Leverage
I get it
I'll be smart
I don't know about that father
I can do this
here we go finally put faith in him I
promise
[Music]
you too
[Music]
[Laughter]
fair play a lot see you later
hope you know what you're doing
it too son
oh yeah Century had like I don't want to
hear how did it you mean how we did it
and therein Liza too I I said last time
syndra had like bandages all over her
head I forgot atreus knocked him down
when he was like running around as a
bear
um I thought something happened in
between that I just didn't do look I
record a lot of these episodes back to
back to back and everything Blends
together and it I tend to forget things
oh yeah also people pointed out that I
didn't even catch it the first time that
when the Leviathan ax met Thor's hammer
that's what caused the lightning to
freeze
it seems so obvious now but there was so
much going on that I just didn't put two
and two together at the beginning so
that's why that lightning bolt is still
frozen on the Lake of the nine
um but that doesn't explain why it's
frozen in that other place that had the
Dragon
I probably should have stayed in that
area a little longer to discover what
was going on there but maybe we can go
back I said let's go back and do all the
Stags and everything so when we go back
to Kratos I try it I'll try and figure
things out I can't let you go back
without this a hammer your key please
foreign
you ever need a way out of a bad
situation throw this down hard and say
wergy
one use only
thanks injury
hope I don't need it me too
okay because I might get out of jail
free card
all right back to old man Hogan would be
waiting in the cabin
in there
anything else I should know about Odin
maybe uh weakness or something
like if I flip up his eye patch he'll
disintegrate I lied well not Bae yeah no
sorry mamir I can't do your accent I'm
on my own for this one
uh-huh
yeah he already flipped off his eye
patch
sorry lad
you're a bit stupid
oh man midgard looks so cool the
lighting here is my favorite
I don't know I I mean everybody knows
this about me that snowy forests are
like one of my favorite Aesthetics but
also just the way light bounces around
in snowy environments is always really
nice
different
Ben
all right
oh my God he's big
you could literally fit inside one of
his nostrils
stop doing that oh are we having a
moment it sort of looked like you were
having a moment I can go no sorry
just fender
okay Ben she's uh
oh I was right about your knife huh
I'm glad you found a place for us yeah
watching my mom's no that would have
been stupid who thought of that
how'd you find me here
uh golf ball
Loki
this is my marble
and where are you heading up
back to Asgard
hey I'm actually using him
uh-huh
anger Boda look
once I see this through
I'm Gonna Know
everything
gotta save my father
had to stop Ragnarok
and maybe hopefully
had to bring our people back
Loki those are all very Noble intentions
but he's Odin
you have faith in me
right
my faith in him of course I do it's so
low though
I just hope the story you're writing for
yourself is the one that you truly want
you
would you take care of fan while I'm
away
I'll take good care of them
oh night boy
can you even feel that
here we go yeah
be careful Loki
like I know fenders must be big in Norse
mythology but I just love how big he is
he's bigger than I thought they would
make him usually they kind of make him a
little smaller
I love that
also I didn't mention before
um
about anger Boda in Norse mythology
Angry Bird is uh Loki's wife just got
it so there were so many things going on
I just forgot to talk about it but easy
right
he's probably in a study probably but
anger Boda in Norse mythology is Loki's
wife I think
um and her and Loki together give birth
to fenrer yorman Gander and
I think it's hell
um
so in this one I I guess they're doing
it a little differently that she just
kind of seemed like a love interest for
him but the fact that they created
jorman Gander together as a snake in a
cabin like that instead of birthing him
um it's kind of cool it's it's a neat
Twist on the lore and they they've done
that a few times
um
Acer bow
okay
nicely equipped what needs work I
have the AC or bow though and it's maxed
out
I I don't know what you want from me
Beast bones I also don't know if I
should be upgrading that one
I really need to take some time to go
through this
um
first runic error from a full quiver is
more damage that's a good one as well
yeah
there's just a lot of things
going on
all right let's head out holding them
back
I miss you like you miss your other eye
hold on
oh you're not interrupting anything
for said he's investigating so the truth
will come out soon enough
I hope it does
you'd better go I think her voice
actress is
um
oh Emily I forgot her second name she
does the voice of Elena in Uncharted
I think you responded to that so yeah
you should leave
yes okay
lovely sunny disposition
you good
can I not interact with you
good good good moves good moves
you know yeah
now if our enemies are made out of wood
we're kind of screwed because you
haven't put a dent in that thing okay
the Panic does nothing
harness it
heimdall's dead
happen to know something about that
anything I already got hit by a car wow
weirdest thing
everyone hated them
sure sure
but have you seen anything something
noteworthy
[Music]
you know he did sock through pretty hard
while we were out
maybe someone found out
even I I don't know
are you suggesting my son had something
to do with this
I don't know
honest
well I have to ask
never believed you had anything to do
with this
I'm glad you're back yeah he does he
knows
I feel like he knows everything that's
kind of his thing so I figured out what
went wrong
I mistranslated a word here did you know
I thought it said beyond the Cry of cold
breath but
it actually reads the Cry of first
breath
well that's somewhere else
entirely I know where that is
young man you've done it again go take
the mask take the sword take the bird
find Thor
going to need for life
also I really thought he would be way
more
C2
I thought there'd be way more Buzz
around the fact that Heimdall died like
hey Ingrid you wouldn't happen to know
where Thor is
yeah I figured
like Heimdall dying is a pretty big deal
right no one can touch him he sees
everyone's intent he's never lost
I know he's dead and everyone's just
kind of like like he got hit and he was
like wait how'd you do that and then
died and now everyone's just kind of
like well heimdall's dead
never mind the fact that he was
entrusted with the gallerhorn and that's
supposed to signify Ragnarok and all
this kind of other stuff that's going on
with it like why are people more
maybe a while before I can fix up my
equipment again I already did that
what you guys talking about me
whoa your head is like moving
independent of everything else all right
uh hi you seen poor anywhere do you know
where I can find Thor
all father is sending us on another
mission why would I tell you where to
find anyone I cared about
look it's fine if you don't like me or
trust me or whatever
I want you to know that you're hurting
her excuse me
through it's going to be a valkyrie one
way or another you know that
if you don't stand with her you're gonna
lose her you may be working with all
father and enjoying his little bubble of
protection
but stay out of my family's business
enjoy your freedom while you still have
it
[Music]
yeah I couldn't get in your nose up in
people's business there traits right
also who's playing music in that room
hey through
[Music]
whoa
why don't you use that
freaking Rasengan shuriken
hell yeah that's way cooler
uh there you are through
sorry
um All fathers said I'm supposed to head
to niflheim with your dad
I haven't seen him around and I was
wondering if you had any idea where he
could be
he wasn't with grandfather no
I think I know where he might be
follow me
I uh
also wanted to talk to you about
Heimdall don't
not here
you're right later don't tell her that
your dad killed him
don't trust anybody here I know oh she's
cute she's got fiery red hair but
[Music]
wow
back in hellheim I forgot how cool this
looks I told you I'd help your mom
understand how much becoming a valkyrie
meant to you
I wanted to uh
but you know that I meant it you did it
Andrew's still alive I did think she was
gonna choke me with her hair I'm
honestly surprised she didn't
thanks lucky
I can't remember much about Sif
from Norse mythology is that a thing she
does with her hair does she fight with
it does she strangle people with it is
she Bayonetta
weapons aren't allowed inside we'll have
to check them why
just do it
come on
oh
come on they're not gonna let you in
otherwise
oh hey dude
all weapons aren't allowed huh what is
with the big hammer then
Brown
he'll be here
Thor
can I get through as well excuse me
excuse me sorry nice nipples oh God
sorry yeah I probably shouldn't have
said that my bad
um
it's fine
so he lands is tour anywhere around I
should look at him to say to them
sitting there in the chair about 10 feet
tall
seems like it might be a bad time so
if you need a moment I totally
understand
no rush but
right where I thought you'd be
you shouldn't be here
you shouldn't have brought her here
she brought me here dude
what are you doing
relaxing
did I say no rush
I meant we should get going right
we don't want to keep the all father
quiet
he's right you should get going
[Music]
bad
thank you
don't do this
it's already done
let it be known the God of Thunder is
good for two things
killing Giants
and fishing knees
the man who disagrees
will greet mjolnir
with his face
yeah you and me both Thor
two tall powerful men yeah
Thor
hmm
Cuban is waiting outside
please let's just I said quiet boy
my name is oh
brother
what no come on no no I swear that
really wasn't food
turn into a bear
oh
okay we're gonna get kicked out
a little help
thank you hey
how's it going
I feel like Ingrid is a bit too much I'm
just beating these guys up in a bow
anger is just slicing bits of them all
thank you
do you like this little spin move I got
going on
come on come on who wants to go
okay I can't really do much else except
this
but it's working
I love the music ah she doesn't feel
like a back home in the Palms
everyone better to shine out of each
other you think
too much
thanks Ingrid
they're slicing people up though I don't
think we should be allowed to do that
oh Father the old daddy's gonna be
pissed
Gary gets smacked around by a young lad
oh you're going to
get him through
whoa whoa
nice nice
boy boy boy
I've got some fight in me Thor are you
seeing this are you bro
okay
excuse me
how dare you call my mother that
having a good time aren't we
certainly am
the feeling of Bloodshed in the morning
I'm so glad that everybody else back
home thrusted
trusted me to do this
you like that
whoa
they always I I told my dad I'd be smart
I told him that I would do it to trust
me but this is the opposite of smart
home to hair
check off
oh I don't think he's waking up from
that
ah
what if you started again right now just
put down the
[Laughter]
grab his arms oh my God good fight
it's interesting that he can even get
drunk I'm sorry damn like this like this
no no it's fine really
that guy got melted strong but you gotta
help me
all right there's one still standing
well he's on his knees bud
come on it's not that far come on don't
worry time to go to sleep
I do like this though Thor in Norse
mythology is a drunkard
and pretty much is only good for two
things killing Giants and drinking
so this is probably the more accurate
representation of them that I've seen
we don't have to walk the whole way like
this do we
let's put them down there yeah oh thank
God of War
what is legs
Thor
get up
sorry
you are going to needleheim with Loki
all father's orders
you have to get up
I know you
disappointed no no no no that was a
glorious fight
if you can't even say you're sorry this
time can you because what's one more
broken promise
foreign
father treated you like crap
you were struggling I get it
but you can't just
we're here for you
[Music]
mom and I
are here
for you even when you're here
we love you you know that
I just thought this was behind us
I [ __ ] up
wow
can I get you a water or something
great going into battle
with a drunk
weapon of mass destruction let's make
this quick
I heard you get back to Asgard the
eternal chasms
okay at least this time they're telling
me the way forward
so I can go the way Secrets all I want
oh
what's going on here
foreign
is way different than the maze I saw a
few Winters ago if you came through
tears Temple then yeah
oh an evil oh yeah moose Believers where
you go to do all the fights and
nifleheim was where you went to go
through the Maze and you went through
you had like a certain amount of time to
get through it and it had great armor
that you could find
ah I see I remember I need to go back
and play the other game it's been a
really long time
actually since I played it
I think I played it once more after I
finished it in my series and then never
again
fine but I hope you know what's being
right there
I don't know if that's worse the fact
that you know what's what you're doing
but still do it anyway
foreign
gender
whoa
hey why
you don't want to carry you all that way
I'm not your backboard that's the
reasoning
I've always got to say something like
there's a protective magical barrier
around it how do you not know this
yeah anytime you want to chime in there
Thor like don't even worry about it like
I'm not gonna get offended that you want
to help and fight with me
I think it's kind of cool actually if
I'm being honest
ouch
oh that he died way quicker than I was
expecting him to well there's no reason
to bring out the Wolves just for you oh
you fight him I'm getting collectibles
I hope you know that don't need a
lecture about parents
find the thing looks like we gotta head
through that wall
[Applause]
oh
you're a God and you can't drink
no we you go
I bet that feels way better though
I hate getting sick I absolutely hate it
I think I might even have a phobia
of puking
I've been through right have giant son
of a powerful god with impossibly high
how could I ever know what that's like
yeah
he's right you know
uh Wolfies
but yeah anytime I feel like I'm sick or
have to puke or something I will just
sit here like
and sort of like meditate on it and be
very self-aware of like where my stomach
is and the size of it and what it feels
like
and then just will my way through it and
not puke because I hate it
it's the worst feeling
do you think we'll get to turn into a
bear at some point that I'll get like a
an upgrade to my rage
yeah you got him sore well done
[Applause]
good job lines good job
anything over here no
I'm not trying to do anything I'm just
pointing out we're not that different
this is where I came from again
people are saying the guy who plays Thor
is in Sons of Anarchy I've never watched
that show
someone's a squirrel
as in ratatasca I didn't like that
someone in the last game I'm not going
to like it this thing
um I've never seen Sons of Anarchy so I
don't know any of the actors from it
so we've got some similar life what does
it matter
who says we can't
yeah my dad's not even from Norse
mythology and yet he's here
I was he in any of the
any of the prophecies
Jesus stop moving away from me William
he actually had way more Health than I
expected
neat trick huh
okay mask says that way but what are you
and I just
head on out on our own you know
God you're tall you're like 10 times the
size of atreus
pale Meadows
dammit agent again with the griping
calling out a problem with the griping
it's healthy
I bet you're glad I'm helping so much
oh man you're welcome
yeah you've been a big
helpless belly aching is really helpful
ouch
this is much different than when you're
fighting it with Kratos
Uchi Uchi
oh I'm all snowy oh I'm all snowy and
slowly
jump
on his back Thor
beat him up
all right I'll do it
ouch
blast them apart
he destroyed him really quickly I was
working so hard on that I was like
teeing it up getting ready for it and
then you just come along and end it all
in an instant
can't you show up and get all the glory
but it is helpful because I could
actually I get all the glory I get all
the items out of it who's there just
ahead
lasted well I want you to blast this one
as well
I don't think that's where we're
supposed to go so far
it was do you actually want to have fun
it's a new side of him
you you want to get the chest
no
okay
well at least he's having fun
all right let's go Thor it's probably
gonna be this way because this is
another breakable wall up this way looks
like there's a path
see if I figured that out aren't I smart
you think I'm smart right
one pathway coming up thank you thank
you
Freedom out here without [ __ ] you're
looking over your shoulder I uh well
yeah I guess it's different from what
I'm used to in a good way
Thor has like little glimmers it's like
we gotta get up that cliff try something
no
thank you
his face it's better when I know it's
gonna happen
every now and then you get like little
glimmers from Thor of like you having
fun like he wants to be an actual dad
but he's so burdened by who his dad is
and prophecy and all that kind of stuff
that he's just ordered around to do
everything
he never gets to just be himself whoa
look at that
giant bull
Jane bison so
we're close uh maybe I can check I'm
gonna come down here and do this
there you go there you go
there you go
there you go
the whispering gravestone so what was
that
I liked it better when people told
stories well this low-hanging fog is so
cool
in the statue
no it's here
there it is founded
help gotcha
that was close full mask
um thanks or wasn't about to lose
okay we did it
we are on the verge of great things all
of our work together
you're welcome
I'm sorry you are here why his father
murdered heimdell for said he has proof
take him no leave him alone I command it
you said no more AC or blood would be
spilled you said family comes first you
don't think that this is retribution for
him being here
he's put your granddaughter in danger
he's made your son miserable Loki didn't
kill Heimdall his father did your
daughter is old enough to make her own
mistakes and your husband started
drinking again all on his own dismissed
you too a word
[Music]
it's not protecting us
magni Modi our boys
we used to tell them stories by the fire
do you remember
we would carve those wooden horses
we would play and laugh until the sun
sank and they fell asleep in our labs
they were thrown at the all father's
problems like brittle knives to a
mountain face
and for what
what is through what's next
oh
turn my father against me my daughter I
have no idea what's happening you know I
finally thought of something I can teach
you
better be right
oh Ingrid saved me
Ingrid blocked him
you sure know how to plan an exit
Petraeus
I just left the mask
I did it
that's a win for the lads
glad you're safe lad got out just in
time pretty sure I burned my bridges in
Asgard though
wait why were you out here Century told
us where you would arrive should you
find trouble Oh I thought you might have
been exploring without me you know a lot
your dad was just concerned though now
that you mention it
please it's also crowded and turns back
home don't you miss the three of us out
finding I really do
exactly
it's not the worst idea
I do want to show everyone The Mask but
it'll keep
this likes a little thing
I do miss the three of us on our
adventures I missed when it was just us
going to spread mother's ashes on a hill
Mountain whatever
it was so much easier back then
um that moves behind
not
do I have anything to get at the eyes
about oh that's niflheim as well
the rest can wait thank you brother
the mirror
if I hadn't accidentally defend your
soul into my knife
he would have gone to the light of
alphan when he died
right I but he a God or a human who died
in battle a valkyrie would have taken
him to Valhalla or a full former had he
been a human or God who died outside of
battle he'd been cast down to Hell hype
was a wolf so his soul would have joined
all the others in our fight like mothers
yes
like your mothers
do you think atreus could go to the
light in alfheim and pull Souls out of
it
I don't know
probably not but
do I have enough things for this
oh thank you there Brock
it's what I get
is it a machine gun a bike
meteoric slam oh
oh that's cool
oh upgrade immediately
yeah yeah let's have a look at it
Oh wrong one
damn
tight
I'd love to brother but I have no idea
where we'd look what if the Keeper's
even still alive
seven find her
I only have seven Audi rabies
and then we can get the ultimate
treasure and I'm assuming that Raven
keeper is like a boss or something then
afterwards
let's do it did you dig up some more
blueprints
well I can get Dwarven steel here now
um
yeah my resurrection Stones carry over
that's nice
let's make something there can't upgrade
those
or this
or that
uh what was this one again chance to
Grant a health burst on any successful
spear kill yep
why are you holding it like that
yeah hold it like that cool
um luminous alloy new
uh okay luminous alloy I need and the
kid
need something special yeah oh
I could upgrade this one 62 to 73. damn
good fit
a good fit my boy my dear lad
we've gotten we've gone through so many
armors what was the starting one again
combo finishers have a high low chance
to Grant strength
no honestly I kind of just like the look
of the dragon armor the most
I'm not a big fan of like full chest
pieces and full chest plates I like when
he has the sort of shoulder pauldron on
more than anything uh
like these sort of ones because I think
that looks more like Kratos
but
it is pretty tight I want to go to this
one and do
the Stag that's there and maybe look
around and do a little bit more
so I feel like there was a lot more to
do with it I just didn't finish you
should visit the crater again we still
have unfinished business there see the
Warriors still haunt The Creator we
could put them to this and what else we
have a lot of things that we could do
also the door actually showed up before
you guys stopped talking
oh
that's nice
it looks hungry come on already just
come back with me I don't care how
hungry you are give an interesting thing
nom nom
inal that's right we got more food at
home come on I have to see what a nice
change of pace helping these dogs get
home for a moment I was worried we'd
have to kill them yes you had a plan to
kill it if it had a tank of course in
our journey to deliver a phase ashes it
was a yot in our statue of do rap
thrower say pronounce that
the Stag of winter that aided our
Passage through the mountain of midgard
it is only fitting when atreus was too
excited to sleep Fey would sing of the
thriving Slumber the sleep of winter
that allows for the dreaming of spring
the body needs rest she would say but
the soul needs to dream that's nice yeah
yes
um why are you showing me I have new
why
oh temporarily slowing down surrounding
enemies when burying
oh
that's pretty damn good
increasing the timing windows on Paris
is also good especially for bosses when
their attacks hit so hard but being able
to slow down time like is that I parry
and then I have one second to do
something
I'll stick with the timing window
yeah until I get more stuff for that I
still really want to know
how this happened I don't think there's
actually a way to get to that
I feel like they were talking about it
previously and I
wasn't listening because there were so
many other things going on
I think you get to an area and it's so
overwhelming it's like okay what do we
do first and then there's a dragon in
the distance like okay should I fight
him or
I had this thing I didn't do
let's go do that I wonder what landed
here
oh wouldn't it be so cool
since time travel stuff is sort of
hinted at all the time and this is here
wouldn't it be so cool if it like went
back in time and Thor and Kratos fought
each other here
indeed lad
um
um what have we fought here in our like
fight
caused this crater
and like exploded everything out that'd
be so dope
now I'm going to be upset if that
doesn't happen
or if I can slam a second time
ah so close wait
are you stuck
atreus why are you over there
I think he's legit stuck
cool cool totally fine
I haven't gone over here this is what
I've been missing but I can't
actually walk over there so maybe
changing the time of day
I don't know
that's why I'm always reluctant to kind
of come back and do these bits in the
episodes because I like keeping the
episodes moving I like the pace of them
I like the flow do a ton of side stuff
then move on to a ton of story do a ton
of side stuff
when it's bouncing back and forth like
this I feel like it just interrupts the
flow too much that's why I cut out some
of the fighting as well and added well I
don't but ask the editors to like edit
things that way
to just keep you guys in the series more
to keep you in the flow of it more
instead of bogging it down with
so much unnecessary stuff I still can't
get over there
how do I anything
if atreus is here he'd probably be able
to help me
I don't even see a way to it
oh there's another guy all the way down
here
uh who's it whoa okay hello
oh atreus isn't even able to hit these
yeah they're coming together
but I can't do anything against them
because you're not able to hit them with
your bloody arrows because you're too
far away because you're stuck
what am I supposed to do now
beat the crap out of you anyway
oh did that still work
nice I was hoping that one no I didn't
you know that's not good to work brother
sorry mamir sorry it's not your fault
you're still going
throw your horns already
how about this
it knew
ah
where you at
watch it come out coward
I think they're gone
let's bring these a traces arrows I
think can go through
walls
he just has a range on him
there we go this is the last
okay
where'd she go she will be back
I'm Tracy's claim to wash up Scotty but
they kill just a kill she would have
never wanted that no
there's purpose here
whoa where am I
the sinkholes
I'm surrounded by all of this
ah
I was wondering how I got down here it
didn't seem like there was anything on
the map at first
all right time to sink in some holes bro
there she is
get her boy
nice this is good because now they're
getting not getting knocked back they're
just sitting in it
ouch ouch
I can't block that can block that one
though
again you're such a coward
a tactical Retreat wise I think I know
who this Hunter says brother the ACF
called up the Untamed Fury
Vania refugees family hid in this jungle
to escape the easier
but it was the Untamed Fury who found
them picking them off night after night
until they were all dead we chose the
wrong jungle and her Retreat is
strategic
no Richard were you broken again
her Retreat is cowardly and we all know
it
none of this strategic nonsense Kratos
nice I think I saw another one of those
up higher
yup
nice
Gotti okay there's two
oh
my God what was that trellis from the
earth or something else I've never heard
of Tremors in banahan something is
causing this
okay that was
big
maybe it's uh
maybe it's Kong hollow Earth theory and
all that
[Music]
oh deep Bellows he can feel it in your
orders
I want to fight it what is it let me add
it
well I'm gonna get down there
uh-huh uh-huh
oh I'm going there
just try and stop me you won't
coward
another way maybe I'll kill the Untamed
Fury
might [ __ ] around a little and find out
she's gonna show up here
what is it
that's probably just like a dragon or
something
yeah you get away from that thing so
you're not getting healed by it
I don't care about her
don't go in there though
you [ __ ]
just oh just just come out here just
come out here and fight I'm not in the
mood
not in the mood to juggle these things
and have a trace hit that and have it
last longer and all that jazz and I can
just get you to come out here do this
and then the fight will be over way
quicker
see much easier
[Music]
okay stick her with a load of them
yeah I know but sometimes they land in
her anyway
you know
you know they say they're not as good as
the other guys
I've made that joke too many times don't
don't laugh at it don't even give me the
satisfaction
I learned that my jokes are
turning into dad territory if you're
reading this we are dead okay cool
pack it up let's go home no need to read
any further if you're eating this you
are an Acer who finally caught up with
us nope if you're reading this you have
shown more curiosity than your other Ace
your brethren if you're reading this
know that we failed
know that though we failed there will be
others if you're reading this know that
all the rains and end if you're reading
this know that you and I will meet in
hell I'm for sure in this urinary
weekend
nice story nice story lovely Lads
um to go that way or towards the
lumbering somber
it's unluck this at least
at least actually oh hey the autumnal
stash hey how about you follow me back
home oh get it yeah no no
there you go
nice wooden stag
I want one of those in my living room
down halfway there I do not
get nice
dunier
once during a great storm Faye told me
that the story of autumn stag denier
also called The Sound of Thunder to my
regret I remember it little I only
remember her the fire in her eyes the
passion in her voice her lovely sweet
curvy hips the scent of wine coming off
her very being animated by the colors of
the season and the ferocity of the Winds
the memory of her spirit long outlives
her words
that's how you know you've made an
impact in someone's life that long after
you're dead they still think about you
well screw you
oh well at least it's attacking someone
besides us yeah that's not what I heard
that wasn't the big lumbering dumbling
I can't pick that up
oh
can I can I join
well that's not working what do I keep
doing it
okay
nice
okay cool thanks thanks for letting me
know I mean I probably would have taken
me a while but at least I would have
liked to figure it out on my own
can I break this one from this side
didn't you even give me a second to
figure it out which is I just break the
pillars
okay
the burden and skies
I'm working on it
I like the ones that stay
oh hey
am I getting closer to that hey
five hours do not
two hours
East
I said
I'm going to find this Valley
a new home
after release
so what happened right
come on remember
I know that I wanted it
a new life do you remember seeing
anything that could help us find the
other half of your hourglass
there were
three
one
sounds like my stomach when I'm hungry
okay your thing I don't care as much
about I care more about the rumble
tumble that's going on
well it was never going to stop that's
why he sent the door
challenge who knows but the truth is
waiting for us brother
oh
there must be a way across have we
looked everywhere what if oh
wait wrong one what if they fought Thor
and caused that lightning
oh that would be way less cool
uh defeated don't get me wrong Faye is
awesome but I want like time travel oh
whoops
foreign
it would be cooler maybe we'll get a
flashback like that Kratos will wake up
in a dream again and he'll be next to
fate and she'll be kicking the crap out
of Thor oh maybe that's why he said this
feels familiar
no don't do that though
I don't want it to just be that he
fought Faye and that's why he's saying
all this stuff I wanted to be that he
went back in time and fought Kratos
oh it's not going to be tight wait no he
sends jorman Gander back through time so
there has to be something like that
going on I watch my head on these walls
brother am I not always care
well yeah always the lightest touch
if something destroyed this tunnel on
its way through it must be big no matter
the size every creature has a weakness
yeah
start talking about it's huh Flappy arms
and then
a Craig jar oh it's one of you
what do you drink
okay okay
auto aim helps a lot of the time but
then other times it doesn't at all
come on
is that it okay
nice
unleash hell
oh you're getting you're getting
everything that I have to offer right
now
that is not doing a lot of damage
okay I'm quite happy with that
oh
my God
what are we trying to deflect that it's
not like I can send that back at him
[Music]
nice
this is a mistake but we'll do it anyway
oh never mind he can't get through okay
sometimes they have attacks to get them
through anyway
is your thing gonna come back or do I
just is that like a one-time thing that
I got to do
nice
you felt it
I'm the one who's acid beat
nice
that didn't do anything
charges the boy for once will you
leave me alone
[Music]
send your little wolf Boys in
ouch
I was trying to do a cool thing where I
dodged and then came back in for a hit
uh-huh
okay
that was awesome
oh I wanted to kill animation
end to all the shaking maybe by the time
we're done in this Valley it won't be
such a bad place to settle down
oh that was so fun I like those types of
fights
I like the sort of one-on-one fights
where it's like okay pace yourself learn
the attacks Parry this get the timing
right that kind of stuff
when it's a whole bunch of enemies all
at once and you have to like be aware of
everything that's going on around you it
just gets overwhelming if anaheim's
great crater we encounter the Drake
known as cragjaw a digging Beast who had
destroyed many of the Vanier stone
structures it called home perhaps with
this creature gone the quaking here in
Anaheim will cease
um
okay which one do I want to go do I want
to go out or
I should go through here
I just don't want to miss any Treasures
that might have been in this room
oh three things in this another one of
those mysterious crystals
100 pieces of the Christmas phones
Manheim Crater of no value on his
currency but if purified it may be
useful for it today delightful
that looks like ratchet again oh no it's
close to tsushima eastern specter
the proud Maple cries a standoff makes
three men fall and the wind moves on
it's a haiku that's a good one I like
that one
the other one is baseball people pointed
out something about like nine Warriors
or something like that like baseball
really
because they're all PlayStation
exclusives and Playstation games so it's
MLB The Show
it's like I don't care about baseball or
baseball games
of course I wasn't gonna know that one
oh you interrupted me
you big stinker
where's your source
up there okay
ouch ouch
ouch
couldn't even see you before you were
beating my ass into the ground
I love that combo
it's very strong if you can get all
three attacks to hit
[Music]
hey y'all
nice
burn baby burn let's go Inferno
oh I like that music
look at that fancy a dick brother wow
kind of
do you think there'll be a reasoning for
the paint on the walls this time
or are we just under the impression that
it's uh
it's just Giants doing it again
ah brother another piece of that Crystal
Trace are you broken again
what was that the lake just react to us
destroying that Crystal it will appear
certainly more alive than those in other
Realms perhaps it's glad you got rid of
that Crystal
seems like the pawn still wants
something
what if you threw a crystal in it
huh
okay but I don't have a crystal to throw
in
like is there a crystal here to throw in
or are you talking about purifying this
Crystal
so letting him
should you pick up anything you can
[Music]
oh mistake time of rebirth renewal
oh I've missed the smell of those
flowers so summer is the last one
back already
there you go nom nom nom
foreign just once tagged that thanks for
saving the Realms and all that might
have gotten to it myself and with more
style but thanks you're welcome
sure
I'm surprised brother
you think you're stag would run in
Terror at the sight of you it's not
exactly a calming presence are you I'll
always call good one
I mean he's pretty he's not really wrong
other than Spartan rage moments he's
pretty calm at everything that he does
even when he fights
um is that it here yeah
so many places to go
it's ADHD overload
another one of davaleen's diagrams you
conscience hi he saw that the ACL would
likely use his powerful weapons to cut
down his fellow dwarves so he ripped out
his design pages and Scattered them good
of him well the old father found out
he wasn't terribly pleased
all the way back here whoa
um
let's say anything in my missions about
that I want to fight I want to fight
this person
and then the burning Skies
actually it might even be faster just to
go back through uh
an Idris El gate now to do this
oh God I fell for it again shame on me
every time I come back here
I don't know how to get across this
I I know but what's interesting is
look at this
watch this okay are you with me are you
watching
over here on the left at the very left
side of the screen you can see one of
those trees
that has one of those tree testicles on
it the ones that I'm always like can you
guys get up and pick up that
which makes me feel like there's
supposed to be water in this area or at
some point there will be
but I can't get across this yet
it's very confusing to me
you know what we'll come back to it I
want to do the story anyway there's so
many things happening in the main story
now that I kind of want to keep that
going and not bog it down too much with
this this is all fun extra stuff to do
when I want to show off as much as the
game as I can
but at the same time
we just stole the mask from Odin
and Ohio's dead like I don't want to end
this episode without getting
further into that
oh
so nice and quick when guys aren't
talking all the time
hello
I'm back
I'm back everybody hey you made it I'll
get here do you want to set the table if
you're ready see I told you the key
would get him home because you tapped it
with a hammer Dwarven magic makes no
sense right
lunda one time
made me a breastplate out of dog barks
you're back I still can't figure that
out are you okay I'm fine I just hope
unlocking this thing was worth the cost
you have it what did it show you I
didn't get to use it they found out
about Heimdall I had to run but at least
Odin can't use it either but
didn't get any answers from the mask
all you've done is steal Odin's greatest
treasure yeah just after your father's
killed his most loyal Ally
none of us are safe even here so we have
no choice we find cerder sound galahorn
and bring Odin to Justice now you'd
incinerate every soul in Asgard and call
it self-defense does he ever suggest
plans or just crap on everyone else the
obvious plan is staring you in the face
we don't need Odin to use this
we can slip into Asgard and do it
ourselves right under his nose we gain
the knowledge we need to shatter this
prophecy of War once and for all except
begging your pardon you don't have a way
into Asgard got the big horn don't they
oh so you expect them to sneak into
Asgard blowing a horn that sounds across
all the rounds
[Laughter]
just
think about it yeah how the bloody hell
are we supposed to do this also tears
plan is
this mask weird
the answers that it promises
I know this
shortcuts always have a price
The Chase
you have carried it what do you think
I think it's a chance
not worse we'll have something Odin
wants his Leverage at best if it really
gives us all the answers then we can
make our own path Nobody Has To Die
I don't think that's how this works no
we needs a way to ask God
I know I've been a burden to you all
I know you've questioned why you even
pulled me out of that hole
I have two
but it's clear now
this is what I'm needed for
this is my purpose
one last time
I will pick up my Spear and
I will lead us to Asgard
it's me but if you got a way to Asgard
where's that idea been this whole
[ __ ] while that's
rather a fair question brother yeah
who the hell does God
you would have gotten us all killed and
we needed to give Loki time to find his
destiny
[Music]
here it is
he keeps calling him Loki
if we can get inside I'm going after
Odin I will not stop you we can do both
spot on brother if the Mask doesn't give
us an out we'll still have that drop on
him works for me let's do it then and
quickly before he sees us coming
he does hate surprises
put it on your damn spruce
I want to hear the details on this side
yeah I don't trust them anymore
it's an ancient path we can't reach it
from here what
let me collect my themes and I'll show
you you ain't got no things and where
are you going with that math rock that
belongs to the kid he earned it all
you've done was make passable dirt soup
Brock it's okay no it ain't this ain't
right yeah something feels way off
like what's with him calling you Loki
anyway
you know that ain't his name
hey I'm talking to you you'll never shut
up Odin
[Music]
pull the things let go of the boy and
face me tell your brother let's do a lot
and you've got a deal
he dies down now it wasn't part of the
plan but if he guys we are square for
Heimdall and honestly you got a bargain
I will kill you plan on that so nice
spending time with you again Freya
please
can't be in two places at once Frank
hey
I don't move you don't move
dude what the [ __ ]
killing you will not be one of them
hi I'm in control here throw me the mask
now
ah
yeah
too bad son
looks like war after all
yes
what the [ __ ] dude no
save him
you have to keep
you can't
maybe if I go back to the lake
got me
[Music]
I know what you're done
and I forgive you
should get his job
yeah let's go
laughs
bro
[Music]
God damn it man
this
whole time
here was he Odin since the beginning
what do we do now
now we kill [ __ ] yeah we do and anyone
who gets in our way
come
what
where
it does not matter
oh [ __ ]
[Music]
I thought he was going to blow the horn
run away from this Kratos Odin won't
stop until we stop him we need you here
well this isn't the obvious choice so
leave wait wait wait hold on
was he Odin that entire time
he even hinted at it that can't be in
two places at once frigg so does that
mean he was in two places at once the
whole time
God he was suspiciously missing and some
of that when I came back here he was
like in his broom closet
dude that's [ __ ]
did he really just kill Brock it's like
when Dobby died all over again
that's it Brock just dies and we move on
immediately
what the hell
oh my God every contextualizes so much
I'm kind of excited to go back and see
it again or play it again and see where
all those hints were when he called him
Loki I was like wait that's out of place
do you work for Odin I thought it was
going to be that he was double-crossed
or we were double crossed that he was
going to be working for Odin and Odin
was like let them come in and break you
out I won't make it too hard for them to
get to you
because I did think breaking him out was
a bit too easy
oh my God
so old knew that whole type laundry was
so calm
oh
and Kratos knows Kratos knows that if we
do everything else if we let this be
what gets us then we'll just go straight
to war
and Ragnarok will happen so he's still
trying to avoid it
father can we
all right
I want to go hunting
I will follow we are with you atreus
you mean like deer hunting right again
like the start of the previous game not
Odin hunting
which way we headed like the way of deer
in
the direction of deer
that's twice know he's given his
father's name back to him
dude I'm pissed
huh
Oh I thought we were following you
I can't believe that
Brock new too Brock was on to him
Brockett smelled [ __ ] a mile away
and that got him killed
it's music you wish to speak of what
happened
I think I heard something
this way
he just needs space
yeah
they're leading that way
and I was I was going to say poor atreus
but poor sindri
syndra brought him back to life
violence changes
changes you are not weak to feel its
effects we're all feeling its effects
I mean atreyus just feels fooled that he
thought that he was being smart by going
to Asgard and talking to Odin and
gaining his trust and then uh like
double crossing them and doing stuff on
the sly he thought he finally had
something that he was good at that he
was smart about and then it turns out
that Odin was lying to all of us and
we're heading the right way
it's bound to make him feel a little
embarrassed branch is over there
like what he did was all for nothing
basically
seeing it
the night
Brock
Century's face
son
there it is
it's the same as the first one he killed
back in the first game
[Music]
accuracy over speed
yeah
why
that was running
I
don't understand
it must stop the bleeding
or it will die
we have been wanted
this is a distraction
it's my fault no
should find syndra
I have a pretty good idea where he might
be
lead
every night to forget to play as atreus
now with Kratos in the back I know that
wouldn't really make sense for the
gameplay mechanics but is it okay if we
take the sleds
I need to think about what I'm going to
say to him
of course
damn so is real tear just dead then
everywhere I look
I'm reminded of my mistakes
our actions have consequences to be
reminded of them there's not punishment
feels like it
yeah I guess remember the lesson from it
instead of reminding yourself of how
miserable it is
that
damn man
it was all over so quick though I've
seen through a deception that fooled us
all
stopped an attack you could not predict
there is no if atreus
your father's right there are things
even Gods cannot control
I don't get though how just Brock
pointing it out to him is the thing that
finally turned him
I feel like Odin would have had more
composure than that
oh
use fin room
have him go bite Odin's balls off
we can take the sled when you're ready
are we opening the gate what's happening
I see
man this is no tessellation and
deformation is so nice to look at here's
Temple
it's where we're headed
boy
he's got heavy
is there a chance that we could bring
Brock back
injury did it once
maybe we could figure out a way to do it
again
I'm afraid not little brother when a
soul missing its pool here it's
Direction like drops knees extractorial
form Well it can't reach the lake of
Souls
he's not only dead he's been denied an
afterlife oh great everything to bring
back
if there was anything we could do I
promise you we'd be doing it
enough
it was stupid of me to Hope in the first
place
take a nine
I miss when the lake was still water
I feel like I want to get on a boat and
just sail away from here
from everything you cannot sail away
from your mistakes
it is impossible to forget them
where are we going other side I have
tried I don't follow you no matter where
you go little brother
you are to sail do a tour somewhere
that's a good message
sailed towards something instead of
running away from something else
I left at the end of the bridge it still
work
we can get up to the temple that way
oh
good doggies
foreign
since we've been here
oh until like oh that's cool
sort of like symbolism as well
that that's tears statue down there that
got destroyed in the fight with balder
and the dragon so now that he's killed
tear turned into Odin and killed Brock
and now we're going to find sindri with
his dead brother and you see that
looming over it
that's cool that's Artistry right there
I'm gonna blow the horn again yes what
makes you so sure Cindy will be here
that's where he and Brock reunite
foraging something that broke
he'll be here
he is
[Music]
century
[Music]
it's injury I
[Music]
I am so sorry no
[Music]
no I don't want to hear it
you don't know what sorry means
we're not letting Odin get away with
this
would that be the Odin you invited into
my home
oh
but some of us were bigger fools than
others aren't we
I gave you everything
my skills
my friendship
my home
my secrets
my treasures
and you just kept taking
and now what have I got
not even my family
you weren't sorry
this is what sorry looks like
I
what can we do
we
there is no way
there's only you
no matter what the cost
so what you can do
is get the [ __ ] out of my sight
damn
how much is
me
more now you wish
I
I thought we were his family too
we were
oh man it's all gone wrong
this is so sad his character just
completely changed now
there's no making this right
is there no
but I know I'll feel better when we
brought order into justice justice
Justice is not what we seek
it is vengeance
every path I walk
leads back to vengeance
maybe that's all we have left
we must return to Freya
for crayons everywhere he goes he's just
surrounded by violent people I mean
not uh
sympathizes them too much considering he
was once the most violent man on the
entire planet wow
really are going to war
you just come to that
yes
it has
and we were back in svato farm looking
for tear
this isn't what I wanted
this wasn't what I meant
I meant losing Brock we know it Chase
we know
I thought we were still avoiding more
from century
don't take the heart one said in grief
atres no matter how spot-only feel
oh that's so [ __ ] cool to look at
damn
I know we should go see friends
but
I wouldn't mind staying here in midgar
for a little while hi a few last
Adventures to take our minds off the
state of well everything
guys I know you always want to go uh
you know you always want to go
adventuring and reminding me that
there's more stuff to do when other
places to be and things like that and
there's side quests and all that kind of
stuff but the only thing I'm gonna go
side questing now after that just
happened
oh man now I can't upgrade anything
I mean they must come back right
what if I what if they're gone forever
and I can't upgrade now past the point
of no return now
I thought Kratos still wanted to get
away from war though and now he's are we
even Carefree it will still be at the
house don't see why not Holden's back
door in was also his way out without
that blasted Raven apparently hiding in
the broom closet the house should be
secure and she will not turn away allies
in her Vengeance I it's all our
Vengeance now and no more fake tier to
twist our minds around oh our mockery he
made of Tears desire for peace and mind
God
I mean I know Kratos are saying like
we're going for vengeance and whatnot
but we're still going there
I thought he would have fought harder to
be like no we're not going back we're
staying home
you're back
are you with us
good it's time time for what did I ask
time to unite the Realms against Odin
once and for all
to try to unite the realms the real tier
everyone loved him and even he failed
then we better not fail or there will be
no one left to try this is Ragnarok an
audience already had a blasted plan we
have yes we've lost the element of
surprise more than that we have only one
way to Asgard and it's not something
yellow
it means we enter from tears Temple here
asgard's wall is here Odin's host of Ain
haryar will hold the space in between
which means we need armies of our own as
many as we'll answer the call numbers
Odin won't see coming and that's just to
reach the wall to breach the wall we'll
need to find SATA ratatoska was able to
procure this
all three of us will go I know just
where to look it's Splendid all eyes
then who do we think we can get i'll
venture to hellheim try to recruit the
army of the dead and I'll return to all
time to unite the elves just like that
unite the elves after centuries of War
well they really like being all fine I
do
it's a better yes to find Seagram and
most of the free Valkyries Nick good has
no Army no nifelheim nor jotenheim that
leaves only startle time
I'll go to spartal fine oh
syndrome
sure
I said I'll go
so be it
good luck to us all
right
oh man it's happening
this is what the whole game has been
building up to
I got goosebumps behind to find the last
fire giant Hey Brother everyone else's
impossible mission
I'm curious what serger looks like in
this game
do you think he looks dope
I'd like to think so
it's weird that I haven't been to
muskelheim with atreus and Kratos yet
together
you said you know where to look for
certain yeah I unlocked the secrets in
the shrine when I was in Moose behind
with Thor Thor don't worry he didn't see
me go in that was not my worry
now look when we find certain we'll have
to convince him to combine with his wife
Samara combine yeah
when the two of them uh
join
they'll create an enormous Asgard
destroying monster oh my
so just easy work then brother
apologies I have some doubts regarding
negotiations with Russell and held
my thinking is that she may be more
amenable to speaking with a member of
the uh
mimir you needed it or death is a skill
now
I suppose these two can survive a bit
without me
brother he wouldn't mind very well many
thanks
we'll catch up with you later
hey I think I can see Sutter's Forge in
the distance
that's it I wonder why you took my
mirror
I'm well I know why he said he took my
mirror but for like gameplay reasons
usually to take a companion away
because something else is gonna happen
where is she
IM huh
you might be able to see the forge
sure sure
good
wait heads up
heads up
nice legendary chest
decided to isolate themselves in their
home Realms to fight it understandable
hopefully they'll understand why
Ragnarok
I mean
everyone seems to hate Odin
I mean destroying all of Asgard is a big
thing that's like hating one person in a
town and then nuking the entire country
but
look over there
it feels like you wouldn't have too much
trouble getting people to join
it's almost weird that they haven't done
it already maybe Odin has some like
insane power that we just haven't seen
yet
is that bite Frost all over your brother
yeah I guess my mirror's gone now he
can't be like
Frost look out brother you're covered in
it hi
I think the force might be past this
lava for you know this uh hunch when I
was here before I got a pretty good feel
for the layout
oh the lighting on those rocks is so
realistic
Oh I thought you were pointing that that
was his Forge but there's another thing
right here and another thing right there
all right lead on little man
that's what I call BB as well little man
everything walks into the room it's like
oh man
in case he doesn't want to help us ready
prophecy says he and Son Mara joined but
who knows how they're going to feel
about it now you would try to force
these primordial beings into submission
well I don't know
we can't win this war without them right
you gotta be close I can hear the fourth
Oh I thought that was like
how Brock and sindri do it
and then do three here
and reset
nice
oh
it was probably much easier than I was
making it
something ahead
ready
buzzer
oh
these guys aren't too bad
oh just smack him in the face a lot
like that and then he falls down and
then you
yay
oh that worked real well
okay
I'm trying but it's taking a while for
them to show up
okay there's one
close
I know we fought many of these
rise up
oh nice
[Applause]
yeah
that spear is very useful for breaking
those because when you throw this you
have to like recall it and then you get
another hit and then you get another hit
but in that space of time
you've built up three of them on it with
the spear and then you can trigger them
all
we got some good stuff
are you ready
I think we're close
come on Drew
It's gotta be him
heavy ruining attack
oh it sends out tornadoes
an array of chaotic Cyclones Rampages
through the field damaging all enemies
in its path I really like this one
though
it really keeps stagger going
but I have a lot of XP
let's try it out
oh great this one it's very good
um
fully upgraded dang it
it's fine it's fine ooh two of these can
nice let us go boy
oh I see somebody over there hello
are you serger
he's like Ragnarok averted I'm not
helping you
approach the Ashen man
come on it wasn't long ago that Kratos
was an action man
actually he's still an action man but he
would be called like
Ashen one
Ghost of Sparta those are swords
everywhere
hello
howdy
we seek a fire Giant
go away it is him
oh God he's strong what just happened
hey that wasn't we deal with these
thoughts come on
nice let's just walk straight into it
we already know that yep
another one
nice we are doing a lot of damage to
this thing
oh it's not gonna be enough though
oh there's one of them dead
okay I gotta be careful
Oh I thought I picked up the thing
I thought I had it in my hand and I was
like waiting to throw it
there you go yup
get away from me
is he gonna be like damn I've never seen
someone fight those like that before
yeah I'll help you guys cool
guys are awesome
hey
help me
it looked really cool though or heated
oh
there's an enemy up there
[Music]
what's your plan
[Music]
I was wondering what was going on
that is certain it's got a lot to answer
for
I like his design I won't help you
who are you
who you seek
what's left on him
why won't you help us
I don't
want to
elaborate
will die
right
because you've got so much to live for
not me
her
so what's the point of all this
you keep separate from sinmara just so
you can sit here and wait to die
at least if you joined with her
you'd be together again
we are together
thank you
whoa not her heart
she's got mine
cool it's not much
but it's enough
but you're not even have you ever been
in love
it's pretty good
it is it's pretty great it's not wrong
the fall
yeah he must die
true
but I won't sacrifice her any more than
you would him
sorry
[Music]
come
wait
[Music]
those blades
may I see them
they're pretty cool
[Music]
now this primordial fire in those they
are not of these lands
shouldn't matter
yeah
that could work
What could
those
your monster
but I don't want her involved at all
but the prophecy says you two have to
combine
sure this will work
what have I got you made before
oh that was easy
not here
follow me
[Music]
where are we going
where do we go that's what I asked
Kratos maybe I'm a yotin that I keep
predicting everything everybody's gonna
say serger has agreed to help us if we
do not involve Saint Mara he believes
that his fire channels through the
blades of chaos alone can provide the
spark needed to bring forth the monster
who will destroy Odin and Asgard this
man of Ash cares nothing for his life
only for who he loves he Bears her heart
in his chest and is separated from his
own as he is separated from her I
believe I understand his condition
Spark
which is a place where niflheim and
moose behind me
first Realms came into existence
we're here in Odin Raven you won't be
able to get through this huh
cool
that's a dope effect
can I hey so that John uh starter
steal me
what
you just turned into a fireball
what awaits us at this spark of the
world
Magic
stop
with that and your blades and my heart
be good
smash stuff
you're right but what'll happen when you
change
don't know
won't be me anymore but how will you or
um
future knew you no one to attack Asgard
right yeah
then we're good
hold on guys there's treasure in them
Hills
oh
here it is
the spark of the world this is
beautiful
God damn
who knows we have yellow on
he knows you have the mask
Brock he knows we would see certain to
start this war but what other choice do
we have none
he knows that too
this is so cool looking
looks like we're just out in space like
it's a black hole
this is it what about Samara should we
at least tell her no
it had hurt her too much more than not
knowing what happened to you
loving someone
lesser pain
that doesn't make any sense
promise
you'll stay away from her you have a
word
good Lord stabbing you with the blades
gonna be enough to create this new you
said Mara's heart is cold
your dad's now got my fire in those
blades
enough of me and the Sparks fire go into
enough of her
should work
okay
come here
damn such cool
uh like art style and everything going
on visual effects
it looks like something out of Eldon
ring

oh my God now you got bite Frost health
[Music]
ultimate combo ow
Ed
oh Jesus
oh [ __ ]
ow
wait did I just die do I not have a
resurrection someone did I not buy one
probably because the fact that Brock's
dead and I can't
oh strong
I don't like this
[Music]
that's a lot of damage
yeah
oh you down you down little baby
oh
little help
get away from there
nice
yeah
that was so cool
dad and Bear
[ __ ] yeah
look at him go
[Music]
that's so sick
[Music]
that was epic all right I know we just
went through something incredible and so
hype and so badass but I gotta read a
little bit first about Kristen the Mist
to fight two Valkyries in time to miss
to face both the Sea and the sky as they
crash down as one their coordination in
battle was unmatched except for Dad and
bear is that a boy you're now born it is
a Pity they're fealty to Odin is by
choice and not a corruption abated by
their death I would always prefer a
valkyrie on fight on my side their aim
was to take the mask back to Odin and
perhaps atreus with it I hope news of
their demise travels swiftly to Asgard
did it work
daughter are you there
silence like he's there
is he gonna be massive
will you help us attack Asgard
hear that all we have to do is call him
with gallerhorn when we're ready
oh that's all
can take the Mr Gateway back from there
dude hearing that voice inside my soul
and my very DNA that was epic
oh my God all right I'm Gonna Leave This
episode here what an ending holy crap
that was so cool I'm so pissed though
that Brock had to die and tear was Odin
what up pawn shop boohock
but it feels like now we're actually
ramping up towards the end of the game
we're actually ramping up to
um Ragnarok itself I mean now we've
actually started it the game's namesake
so
I think we're in for a hell of a few
episodes to come so if you want to be up
to date on those don't forget to
subscribe because you're going to want
to be there for when this all goes down
I'm so excited I can't wait see you
tomorrow bye
