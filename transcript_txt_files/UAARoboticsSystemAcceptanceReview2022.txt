iceberg robotics is proud to submit our
system acceptance review video for
consideration by the 2022 university
rover challenge judges panel
entering our sixth year with support
from uaa and many professional
organizations our team chose to iterate
upon and optimize last year's design
we proudly present iceberg four
ice blue robotics is divided into teams
dedicated to each rover subsystem
mechanical electrical software
science and project management
we updated our gantt chart and task list
based on new challenge requirements and
available resources
by utilizing
f e a on mechanical structures 3d
printing industrial machining equipment
and software development frameworks
we rapidly prototype and optimize new
designs and reformulation old ones
iceberg forest chassis was designed
around the extreme retrieval task and
remains largely unchanged from last year
it consists of a main structural member
cut from two inch square tubing that
runs the length of the chassis and two
custom c channel beams that contain
suspension elements
the rover runs on a 720 watt hour
lithium ion battery pack providing ample
power for each competition task
five cameras face in various directions
to give the driver sufficient visibility
at all times
these provide multiple close-ups of the
end-effector and wide-angle views of the
arm and rover the rover uses a set of
900 megahertz ubiquity radios to carry
multiple video streams as well as rover
commands allowing maximum propagation
across terrain
a pair of 5 dpi dipole antennas are
mounted high on the rover while the base
station uses a 120 degree directional
antenna with a 13 decibel gain
the base station runs a custom graphical
application built with wx python for
viewing rover camera streams and
monitoring controlling the rover
it utilizes a navigation system to
display the position of the rover in
real time from transmitted gps
coordinates
and a configurable control system
enabling operation the rover with a pair
of gamepad controllers
for the autonomous traversal mission the
rover uses an onboard gps and
accelerometer magnetometer to precisely
determine its position and orientation
the opencv and tensorflow python
libraries analyze image and depth data
from a stereoscopic camera to detect
obstacles and hazardous terrain and
identify competition markers
our pathfinding system uses a record of
data from encountered obstacles as well
as classification machine learning
algorithms run on an nvidia rtx 1060 gpu
to calculate the most direct path to
waypoint coordinates
we use these data and models to train a
convolutional neural network to aid the
rover to better identify key competition
objects and divert potential hazards
the arm design drew inspiration from a
number of industrial sources the
shoulder is powered by a 200 pound
linear actuator minimizing any moment
forces in the upper arm the elbow uses a
three to one warm gear transmission that
provides smooth predictable motion and
over 100 pound-feet of available torque
this design allows the forearm to be
offset from the upper arm to gain 360
degrees of freedom we elected to use a
warm gear on the wrist
the end effector utilizes a gripper and
a screwdriver system to accomplish the
extreme retrieval and equipment
servicing task three dc motor and a
linear actuator provides a clamping
force of 13 pound feet and a range of
two and a half inches with precision
control of 900 of an inch paired with
the robotic arm and effector has a 5
axis range of motion
the main task is controlled via a warm
drive gearbox minimizing power draw a 3d
printed enclosed prevents dust from
entering the gearbox and belt drive
system
the science plan encompasses a combined
approach that includes visual
observations an array of sensors and wet
lab chemistry to identify signs of life
a camera scans the area for the presence
of animals metabolic wastes tracks
microbial mats iron staining on surfaces
due to microbial metabolic activities
and fossils soil and mineral samples are
analyzed with a variety of sensors and a
computer program that uses arduino and
spectroscopy the samples are then added
to a luminal mixture to observe
luminescence levels to determine the
presence of oxidizers including
hemoglobin proteins urine feces copper
or iron the commercial off-the-shelf
dyneezy power soil kit consists of six
different solutions that purify the soil
samples
then it is tested using a nano drop 1000
spectrophotometer to deliver a reading
of dna concentration dna purity and
nucleic acid purity finally the samples
are introduced took hydrochloric acid to
test for a limestone which could
indicate liquid water and potentially
life in the planet's past this concludes
our 2022 sar submittal we appreciate
your consideration and look forward to
seeing you at the mars desert research
station this summer
