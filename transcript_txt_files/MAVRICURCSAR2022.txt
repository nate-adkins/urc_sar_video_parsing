Hello, the iowa state university rover team mavric 
is excited to introduce you to our new rover  
scarab our team comprises of 13 members 
split up into two sub-teams systems and  
mechanical all working together to bring you 
the mavric team's most advanced rover to date  
our new rover is based on a triple bogey 
suspension system with four corner steering motors  
this allows us to effectively maneuver over 
rough terrain and steep inclines all while  
swiftly steering around any unfavorable obstacles 
the carbon fiber reinforced 3d printed suspension  
members allow for compliance for any hard impacts 
while remaining rigid enough to carry our rover  
our attached robotic arm is also 
the most versatile we've built yet  
offering 5 degrees of freedom a belt driven 
elbow joint and hot swappable end effectors  
the arm also stores a deployable hook 
to assist in any heavy lifting loads  
over the past year the mechanical team has worked 
hard to develop and test our new robotic arm  
we have developed this arm to have very fine 
motor control allowing us to do high precision  
tasks such as typing on a keyboard undoing door 
latches and plugging in a usb thumb drive as you  
are seeing here we use a servo to actuate the end 
effector grippers and the wrist is driven by a  
pair of 12 volt 23 rpm motors the elbow is driven 
by a 550 series motor with a worm gear drivetrain  
and a pair of belts for smooth and stable 
actuation the entire arm system has integrated  
encoders that allow for the inverse kinematics to 
be implemented for ease of control we also have a  
design for a powered allen wrench to be mounted in 
parallel with the rover forearm which will allow  
us to easily loosen the captive screw the arm has 
been proven to perform a wide array of dexterity  
tasks pertaining to the equipment servicing 
mission as you have just witnessed our arm is also  
far from frail in addition to the end effector 
we have a deployable hook for heavy lifting  
hook makes it easy for us to pick up a test 
mass of over five kilograms and the 775 series  
motor on a worm gear powertrain supplies ample 
strength for lifting furthermore our normal  
end effector is fully capable of picking up a 
rope and dragging this weight across the floor  
along with picking and placing a mallet although 
this works we are currently looking into designing  
and implementing an additional end effector 
with increased grip strength and jaw width for  
use during the extreme retrieval delivery task the 
mavric science system detects extant signs of life  
through atp luminometry and extinct signs of life 
via careful visual inspection the science system  
onboard scarab currently allows for up to five 
samples to be tested but is easily expanded as  
most parts are 3d printed the end effector 
attachment allows us to grasp the sample  
plates easily and place them into soil or rub a 
foam covered plate onto a rock sample the dust  
and soil covered plates are then stored into a 
holder from the bottom up removing any concerns  
of cross contamination a swab is then picked 
up from the swab holder which is not pictured  
that will attach to the front right corner of the 
rover the sample is then swapped using our arm  
and the soiled swab is reinserted into its test 
tube our system will then pick up the swab place  
it into the luminometer and a servo will actuate 
the buttons and the sample will be analyzed the  
luminometer will return a value and we are able to 
definitively say that any rlu value over 5 has atp  
present and thus extant signs of life present we 
are currently working on an end effector attached  
hammer solution with zooming functionality to 
closely observe samples for signs of extinct life
systems team has been researching coding and 
implementing different systems to complete  
competition missions our steer motors allow us 
to maneuver the rover using the two main driving  
modes point steering and bank steering when the 
rover is point steering it is turning on a single  
point and follows an arc path around a point when 
bank steering we can also individually control  
each drive and steer motor from the base station 
our base station sends commands and receives data  
from the rover using tcp sockets and displays 
all the information we need to control the rover  
including control accesses buttons data 
displays and a map to help with navigation  
from the base station the rover uses multiple 
ip cameras including a dome camera on the mast  
the autonomous system consists of four 
different programs the main state machine  
pathing object detection and waypoint 
post detection object detection uses  
our realsense depth camera to identify obstacles 
that the rover would want to avoid waypoint post  
detection detects the aruco tags on the waypoint 
post using computer vision with the realsense and  
mass camera pathing takes in all the data 
from the two detection programs and gives  
a path for the main state machine to follow and 
the state machine controls the rover's movements  
to follow the path given to it it has different 
states for following either a straight path  
or an arched path and save for when it reaches a 
waypoint a waypoint post or the end of a mission  
the autonomous system use the gps and imu 
to get the rover's position and heading
thank you for your consideration and 
we look forward to seeing you in Utah
