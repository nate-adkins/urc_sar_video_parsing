the space concordia robotics division is
a multi-disciplinary group of
undergraduate and graduate students from
concordia university in montreal canada
within our team we have sub teams that
handle different responsibilities for
each aspect of the project
the following image shows our team
structure
in addition we are participating in the
european rover challenge because we
believe there is valuable experience and
knowledge to gain within each respective
sub team competing with others puts the
team in an environment that forces us to
ensure our systems meet requirements and
are reliable enough to complete the
tasks within the scope of the
competition
the rover uses a custom-made power
distribution system that interfaces with
the batteries and distributes power to
the rest of the system
it has firmware that actively monitors
and can cut power to components with
irregular behavior the rover is also
coupled with high level operator
software that displays electrical status
for each motor and overall system with a
soft emergency stop for cutting power to
motors and other electrical components
within this high-level software there
are video feeds and sensor feedback to
assist the operators
this allows for manual control of the
rover either with playstation 4
controllers or keyboard controls
a big aspect of the safety system is the
inclusion of a physical hard emergency
stop that instantly cuts power to the
rover in its entirety the electrical
system of the rover is designed to
safely deliver power to actuators and
obtain sensor values and consists of the
batteries two pds power distribution
system devices the main board motor
drivers and the arm sensors the reverse
triple boogie suspension has proven
effective in the past and has been
enhanced this year with cnc machines
links to increase its stability
the mobile platform's height has also
been further reduced to lower the center
of gravity of the rover increasing its
stability over a steep terrain

so
the manipulator has five degrees of
freedom with compliant digits that allow
it to grip around objects
improving its grip strength without
causing damage or marring the items the
arm has also undergone a complete
redesign with new gearboxes and arm
pivots that were designed to reduce
backlash and improve maintenance
the new arm is also considerably more
modular allowing us to change out the
gearboxes under a minute if needed and
allowing for more devices to be added
such as our absolute encoders the dlp
near scan nano or our upcoming libs
fiber mount the arm is also optimized to
reduce weight with topologically
optimized plates
and better use of material netting a 1.2
kilogram reduction in weight the
absolute encoders allowed us to
implement inverse kinematics which
considerably improve the dexterity of
our arm
allows us to perform complicated
manipulation of equipment this is in
addition to our more powerful motors
which allow the arm to move faster while
lifting the same load
the rover makes use of an oster 3d lidar
and z2 depth sensing camera in order to
map terrain and localize itself within
its environment water cooling was also
added to the lidar base to improve
thermals increasing its accuracy
the rover is also coupled with ar tag
detection for helping operators and our
autonomous navigation system navigate
the competition grounds
to test the hypothesis beep will
navigate the mars yard with a webcam
allowing the team to monitor the site
for interesting geological features
during this process the images are
compared to the created excel database
of physical and chemical characteristics
of various known rock and mineral
samples for identification
in addition beep will measure the levels
of nitrogen and phosphorus in soil with
the npk test and will analyze the water
content of the rocks with the near
infrared spectrometer mounted on the arm
of the rover the level of acidity and
alkalinity of the soil will get
determined with aph probe the
consistency of this results will lead to
an evaluation of the hypothesis
