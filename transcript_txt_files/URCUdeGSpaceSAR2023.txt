hi we are the space team and we are
excited to show you our rubber in
wikimina
our dish suspension inspired by our
employee system provides a very
stability for the robber without a
typical structure ready for high demands
and Byron terrains with Association of
six motorized wheels for an optimal
assembly up for difficulty range the
rubber performance is optimized for
requirements of each Mission
the new chassis design improved the
assembly process introducing and modular
system this allows a better word
distribution and practical changes
between each mission
in addition we improve the manufacturing
process thanks to a sponsorship of
product case
in the new Power model a lithium ion
battery Arrangement was specifically
designed for the needs of the system
these batteries can provide a large
amount of energy in a compact package
which is particularly important for the
Rover or space and the way are limited
for remote operation and communication
we use a 2.4 GS Wi-Fi connection we have
opener optional antenna every aspect of
the system control can be remotely
operated and monetarily
in the autonomous navigation team we
decided to use an approach to path
planning via graph traversal algorithms
optimized with the method of time the
elastic band
with the help of a set camera we map the
environment for layer obstacle detection
for the location and orientation a GPS
and a six axis ime sensor are used for
testing we develop a simulation in
gazebo and created a model for the
rubber some objects were also placed to
simulate a trick environment for the
Rover to move around
this way we can test the navigation
system and thought planning algorithm in
this simulation we also test the
location and detection of our Rook
attacks
now a robotic arm is a 5 degrees of
freedom anthropomorphic manipulator at
the top of the wrist we use an IP camera
that monitors the movements of the
gripper the three finger design allows
to press buttons activate switches and
pickup tools with higher Precision in
addition we Implement a hook that is
capable of lifting anchored objects is
lifting 5 kilograms compared to last
year the design had considerable changes
that allow us to optimize assembly and
develop a demonic arm thanks to
implementation of the AQ Motors these
actors of a compact design lightweight
and high torque for the children and
elbow the motors were coupled to a
cyclone transmission with 111 reduction
for the control operation of the r a
robust embedded system with Cam protocol
was implemented which marked the
heuristic signals to angular velocities
and calculates the PID control
this year we will be using a 3-axis rail
system with the connector modes that
constitutes all Laboratory
we collect soil samples using a platform
equipped which shows that can recollect
10 grams of soils and evenly distributed
inside a deposit platform
this deposit platform consists of an
array of capsules where the soil will be
placed there a ph and colorimetary
Analysis will be career
the reactants are indicators with the
Terminator running material and be
moleculars as amino acid nucleic acids
and carbohydrates
the rubber will be equipped with gas
detecting sensors hydrogen potential
sensors archaeological database
this laboratory is prepared to analyze
up to six different soil samples while
abodeing cross-contamination
