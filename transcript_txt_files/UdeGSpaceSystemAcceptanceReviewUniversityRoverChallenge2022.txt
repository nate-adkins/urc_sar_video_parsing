hi we are odessa space and this is our
major prototype
[Music]
in the current edition we will be using
a centrifuge as the main instrument to
mix the samples and the reactants
we will be using colometric analysis to
determine the concentration of different
analytes nitrate nitrates phosphate
hydrogen amino acids proteins
carbohydrates etc
the rubber will be equipped with gas
detecting sensors as well including
methane carbon dioxide and benzene
the laboratory is designed to have an
almost segmented closure so the sample
contamination will not be a problem
the practicality of the test system
based issues and control points allow
the program sequences to have greater
precision at the time of execution
this makes it much faster and the error
is lower the laboratory is designed by
stations in a way that are distributed
in the independence slots
[Music]
the suspension system features
independent support for each wheel
it's mainly made up of upper and lower
different length control arms
which are strategically attached to the
chassis of the bottom and sides do the
motion ratio
the robot rides on 4 10 diameter inches
in fire rubber wheels
this title wheel is lane and had quite
good traction on rocks in slow and rough
size since it of raw wheels the gear
motor for each wheel is mounted directly
to the shack bearing and is protected by
the lower arms
the robotic arm is made of a jointed 5
degrees of freedom design
the arm is designed for using two
competition tasks these include
equipment servicing and astronaut
assistance
the design includes at three degrees of
freedom grease pitch and roll and a
gripper at the end
another zip rubber was added to optimize
grip when adapting to objects to be
picked up and move
the arm is able to perform the required
operations such as typing on a keyboard
as well as targeting the screw
[Music]
pushing bottoms
flipping switches
[Music]
and inserting a memory usb stick
in the autonomy team the rover
geolocation is performed with a gps and
a set camera
this will help us to map the environment
which is described using the method of
occupancy cells and graph traversal
algorithms work
we test the routing algorithms and
analyze the behavior of a rover when
given a point b to reach from a point a
we develop a simulation in gazebo
modeling the rover and with the help of
rocks we perform the communication of
the subsystems
the rectangular frame shape serves as a
balanced mountain point for the
suspension system electrical box and
other devices such as the antenna
acrylic border sheet covers all the size
of the frame as a protective shield from
those while still allowing airflow the
assembly of the suspension system is now
optimal with this new design which
includes modularity in the frame it now
uses a jing a sample system the last
improvement was to regulate the center
of gravity to its death center
[Music]
for a communication and power we ensure
the wireless connection between devices
station and the rover by using a high
power radio for a 2.4 gigahertz
connection
with sector and non-directional antennas
for line of sight communication using
the tcpip protocol through rosmera
operative system that allow all the
boards on the qt1 to be remotely
controlled enabled of completing each of
the tasks of the competition
for the power subdivision we implement a
12v35 amps lead battery and step up and
step down converters so that we can
power the different devices on the
vehicle
