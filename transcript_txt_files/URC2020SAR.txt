University of Warsaw Robert team is
proud to present its newest achievements
our latest revision of the Oslo Frogger
features for high power balloon wheels
as an EVA cell approached a variable
terrain large tire diameter low center
of gravity and relatively high
undercarriage clearance a low for swift
movement over medium-sized obstacles and
safe high speed drive over flat terrain
the set of ocelots cameras allows the
operator to both drive the rover with
confidence even in unfamiliar
surroundings and operate the arm with
great dexterity speaking of dexterity
the five degrees of freedom arm with
both manual and inverse kinematics
control provides both ten kilograms of
lifting force and a millimeter scale
precise control of the claw
predefined my pre movements help with
fast and precise typing on a keyboard or
toggling small switches
no operator no problem
over rubber feet when challenged with
autonomous navigation
Rover can actively search for Waypoint
gates and pass through them with great
precision
the rover can collect several deep soil
samples with our new drill system
samples will be immediately tested in
the on-board lab with numerous
experiments empty detect water
carbonates and of course life
the great progress made since the last
year's URC was appreciated in both
Canadian and Indian Rawal challenges and
our team was awarded the third and the
second prize respectively we are
confident that this year our upgrade and
well tested platform will represent the
highest standard of polished engineering
