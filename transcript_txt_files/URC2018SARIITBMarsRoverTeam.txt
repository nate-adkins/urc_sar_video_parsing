We are the IITB Mars Rover Team,
and have been working on interplanetary rovers
for the past 6 years. Over the years,
we have developed a strong understanding of
all systems of the rover and their interdependencies.
The current team consists of 25 members
and is divided into the Mechanical, Electrical
and bioscience subsystems, in line with the competition tasks.
This year, we have gone for a complete mechanical overhaul of the rover,
designing a system that is lighter, more compact and sleeker
 
We have optimized every system thoroughly, and simplicity has been the mantra for this design.
 
The four wheeled double-wishbone suspension system
is designed for stability and mobility in equal measure
The wide wheelbase provides stability
while the spring-damper system allows our rover to climb obstacles upto 30 cm high
We have gone with differential steer this year to keep the design simple
 
The balloon wheels provide added cushioning
and also sufficient traction
We have tested the suspension on all kinds of terrain
and its performance has bolstered our confidence for URC
The robotic arm this year consists of an open truss design
to minimise weight without compromising on strength
The entire arm weighs 9 kg, while being able to lift objects upto 5 kg
 
The two-finger gripper has 3 degrees of freedom
and can reach upto a height of 1.4 metre
thus being able to perform all the competition tasks
This yearâ€™s electronic & software subsystem has been further refined
to be simpler, modular and easy to debug
We have interfaced readily available hardware
instead of reinventing the wheel and designing things from scratch
Software stack has been developed on ROS, which provides seamless interoperability
The rover is driven by four 18 Volt DC motors
controlled by Roboclaw motor drivers
The motors are primarily run in open loop differential scheme
For autonomous tasks, closed loop control is achieved by PID control over IMU feedback
The arm control consists of mixed open and closed loop schemes
For precise operation, Inverse Kinematics control over actuators
using feedback from inbuilt potentiometers has been implemented
At each point live feedback is taken and visualized
via URDF model on our GUI
Ruckus networks P300 wireless bridge is used to provide wireless communication
 
The modules feature a powerful 14 dBi internal directional antenna
and have been tested to provide a range of 1km
Our Power system has been completely overhauled this year
We have shifted to more robust custom made li-ion battery pack
with active Load balancing to ensure healthy operation
The battery has been tested extensively to provide 1.5 hours of operation
 
We have developed Base Station GUI on RQT
The GUI currently features dynamic GPS-IMU sensor visualisation
a URDF model mimicking the rover state
software switches and multiple camera streams
We get GPS-IMU readings from a custom developed android app using ROS Java
 
IP Cameras, Go Pro Hero5, and Android Phones
have been interfaced to provide video stream
For level 4 autonomy we are using a Xbox one Kinect Sensor
Using its depth image objects in a certain range are detected via a color mask
noise is removed by implementing opening and closing morphological operators
 
For ball detection we utilize the color video feed from kinect
and create a circular contour using a similar algorithm as obstacle detection
the depth of the ball is then calculated using the radius of the circle
The science team has researched numerous Mars missions  both past and proposed
 
looking for feasible markers relevant to the search of Martian life
We will be using a high-resolution camera to generate
a stratigraphic profile to select the ideal digging site
Our bioassembly tests the humidity content
temperature of the soil and ambient pressure
using on board sensors
In search for possible biosignatures, a methane sensor is also included
The soil collection assembly consists of an Archimedes screw mechanism
 
to directly collect soil samples into a detachable container
thus eliminating the risk of contamination
In the field laboratory,  we are conducting chemical tests
for nitrogen, phosphorus and carbonates
as these are the necessary elements for life
Also, we are doing biological tests to detect crucial bio-markers
i.e. bacterial cells and amino acids
As all our systems are nearly competition ready
the next 2 months will be spent on thoroughly testing the rover
We have prepared an extensive testing manual
and will be testing all the systems of our rover
in natural as well as simulated environments
both for the competition and beyond.
