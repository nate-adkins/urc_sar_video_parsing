hello we are the university of toronto's
robotics for space exploration team and
we are proud to present our 2022 rover
platform
this year we focused on improving the
arm accuracy through an all-new arm
improving the science payload through
vigorous research on methodology and
weight savings on the chassis all around
new this year is our mapping and
location capability enabled by a new
suite of sensors including lidar
this year's mechanical design focuses on
durability and robustness while
minimizing weight and size
the carbon fiber rocker bogey and
chassis allows for more efficient
reversal of uneven terrain by maximizing
contact of the wheels with the ground
furthermore the chassis is kept level by
the differential gearbox as the rocker
bogies angled
this year the team also experimented
with 3d printing thermal polyurethane
for wheels
this allows the design of custom infill
and tread patterns to optimize driving
on desert terrain
the wheels are driven by four to one
gearboxes and brushless motors
this year our electrical team focused on
the implementation of three pcbs first
we have our high power board for power
distribution motor control it includes a
circuit to display the battery levels on
a led bar graph and two relay safety
circuitry for the voltage rails the
speed of each motor is controlled
through six 12-bit dacs and use hall
effect sensors with an incremental
encoder to control the drivetrain
next we have our low power board which
uses three buck converters to regulate
our voltage rolls rails with an e-fue
safety circuit and lastly we have our
back plane board which consolidates all
the subsystem pcbs into a single
physical enclosure to protect them from
the external environment while also
being accessible and allowing
communication via usb
the robot arm utilizes seven motors to
achieve six degrees of freedom for
reaching all areas around the robot
the gripper uses two parallel four bar
mechanisms to ensure pressure is
consistently applied perpendicular to
the object's its grasping
and features 3d printed tpu phalanges
optimized to maximize surface area
contact with objects
this year we redesigned the arm with a
focus on precision and consistency
all motors are now geared with non-back
drivable gears either worm or lead screw
this will reduce the power requirements
and increase arm stability
we are also working on making
simulations of the arm system on gazebo
which will allow us to prototype and
test new arm designs and control
codebase with high precision physics
simulations before putting them into
production
this year science team has two separate
systems to tackle rock and soul sample
analysis also sample analysis will be
done in a light isolated payload in
which samples are deposited by the rover
arm into a tested carousel using 3d
printed single-use scoops to minimize
cross-contamination our cell sample
experiments rely on microscopy and
photonics to examine samples and look
for fed molecules this is done by
exciting the sample and using a pmt to
detect the relative concentrations of
fad in a test tube
rock sample analysis on the other hand
utilizes a tube camera system for rock
surface microscopy and for ndvi analysis
which allows us to look for relative
levels of chlorophyll
our software team uses ros melodic to
communicate between subsystems of the
rover including map camera controls and
localization
the rover's drive system is controlled
through a ps3 controller interface with
ps3 joy
this allows us to execute smooth turns
and have controlled acceleration through
analog signals
to ensure our rover can withstand the
challenges of uneven terrain we have
created simulations of the entire rover
on a gazebo that will recognize
areas where improvement is necessary
to ideate our drive code on to determine
the rover's exact position and
orientation the software team uses a
customized ros visualization tool which
will display accurate measurements from
our imu
the autonomy subsystem for the rsx 2022
rover has been designed to be modular
this has been worked towards through the
development of several mini rover
platforms which have been a crucial
effort allowing ongoing development
throughout kobit 19. the autonomy stack
makes use of an ultra-wide view ooster
lidar an intel realsense rgb depth
camera wheel odometry gps and nvidia
jetson xavier for data acquisition and
perception the lidar system is used in
conjunction with the wheel odometry and
gps performs state estimation on the
rover using a kalman filter and further
data from the camera is used with
computer vision algorithms to perform
obstacle avoidance while controlling the
emotion of the rover
thank you for watching our sar and
considering us for the urc 2022
due to local and university regulations
we have only been able to gather
together for the past week or so
but all of our subsystems have been
designed and built individually remotely
and we are working to integrate them
onto the river platform
lastly i would like to thank all of our
sponsors and we look forward to
competing in person once more
