Hello all we are the team Deimos of IIT Mandi 
and here we present you the first version  
of our university rover challenge prototype 
to realize this project a team of 30 people  
subdivided in four different departments 
have been working for months these five  
teams include mechanical electronics software 
biological science and management to deal with  
the uneven terrain and provide enough stability 
we have used a rocker bogey suspension system  
the current design allows our rover to climb up 
rocks with 1.5 to 2 times the diameter of the  
wheels and to overcome an incline of 45 degrees 
for steering we are using a differential turning  
gear dc motors are used to power the balloon 
wheels the motors are connected directly to the  
wheels and which enable the differential turning 
The aluminium extrusion have been used as material  
for the chassis which allows easy assembly repair 
and change in chassis design if necessary for the  
robotic arm we have used a modified 6 degree of 
freedom scara arm the arm is powered by stepper  
motors and belt drives the vertical movement of 
the limb is done by a lead screw mechanism which  
allows precise and accurate linear movement the 
end effector are kept interchangeable a scoop and  
factor for collecting soil samples the equipment 
servicing end factor design includes a 2 degree of  
freedom wrist with a gripper the ip cameras will 
be used in the end effector for the robotic arm  
and for assistive vision of the rover we have 
used intel realsense d455 rgbd camera as the  
main vision of our rover which is mounted on a 
360 degree rotating pole as a central unit we  
chose nvidia jetson nano and for controlling other 
subsystems we chose raspberry pi and stm32 boards  
for navigation and orientation the 9 degree 
of freedom imu sensor is used with gps  
intermodal communication is done through a 
network switch connected to communication module  
along with this I2C and pwm is 
used for intra model communication  
custom pcbs are designed for various 
subsystems the power system is divided  
into power distribution system and power 
management system to power five subsystems  
drivetrain communication manipulator rover core 
and science modules a 24 volt lipo battery pack  
equipped with a custom monitoring system is used 
to establish the communication between the rover  
and the base station we are using obiquity rocket 
ac light operating in the 5.8 gigahertz band one  
omnidirectional antenna mounted on the rover and 
one directional sector antenna at the base station  
the software team aimed to develop an easy to 
use gui for teleoperating the rover from the base  
as a part of autonomous traversal we developed an 
algorithm which uses a combination of odometry imu  
and gps data to localize the rover the depth 
data is used to map the environment and the  
RRT* algorithm combined with an obstacle avoidance 
algorithm is used for automated traversal both the  
map of the environment and the part to the goal 
are updated dynamically when the rover is close to  
the goal location we track the provided AR tag for 
planning and efficient part to the goal location  
for controlling the robotic arm we use the moveit 
ROS package the depth camera is utilized to create  
a local map of the workspace and this map is 
integrated with moveit to plan a collision free  
trajectory live video stream from the arm camera 
is used to assist the teleoperator for controlling  
the arm to detect the presence of existing 
or extinct life forms we have decided to go  
with two tests first one is the cyber safe gel 
staining which will basically be going to identify  
the presence of either dna or protein we used 
an imaging system in the lab we have created a  
similar mechanism to perform the task then the 
other test biuret test will differentiate the  
between the proteins and dna we are also using a 
thermal camera to detect any temperature changes  
all these tests will be on board onboard sensors 
and cameras provide necessary data on which ml  
models are used to make inferences we used a 
ph sensor to measure the amount of alkalinity  
or acidity of soil solution moisture sensor 
to detect the amount of water in soil which  
affects the biological processes a uv rays 
detector was used to find the amount uv rays  
a soil npk sensor to direct amount of 
nitrogen phosphorous and potassium in  
the soil an anemometer to measure the wind speed 
a spectral sensor for the spectroscopic analysis  
of the soil and for the physical properties 
of rocks such as absorbance and reflectance  
the thermal camera will also be used to detect 
life as the temperature of most life forms will  
be higher than the surrounding temperature for 
detecting life forms we have built a ml model  
for rock classification we have built a custom 
cnn which is trained completely from scratch  
the model does a three-class classification into 
one of three one of the three categories igneous  
sedimentary and metamorphic the model is giving 
an f1 score of 0.72 on testing data each team  
is being guided by our team leader and has also 
been assigned some mentors who give their inputs  
from time to time COVID-19 impacted the team in 
several ways the delay delivery timings difficulty  
in accessing labs increasing communication gaps 
etc all modules have been tested separately and  
the team has started integration of the rover it 
took months of effort dedication time curiosity  
enthusiasm and zest for the team to reach where 
it stands today we are all set to complete our  
rover in the given time constraints thank you 
for your consideration on behalf of team Deimos
