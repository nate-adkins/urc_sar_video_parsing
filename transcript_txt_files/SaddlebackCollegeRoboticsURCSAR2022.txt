hi my name is nathan sue saddleback
college robotics is proud to present our
fourth generation rover osiris this year
we organized our team by subsystem
forming the chassis arm drive science
and autonomy sub teams our riveted
carbon fiber chassis houses a total of
four lithium ion batteries chosen for
the high energy density and discharge
capabilities three 12 volt batteries are
connected in parallel to provide 69 000
milliamp hour capacity for the drive arm
and science subsystems to protect
against brownouts and power surge
failure a separate 48 volt battery
powers all computers and networking
electronics onboard the rover
each battery is connected to a battery
management system that protects against
overcharge and over discharge we have
designed a kill switch pcb that uses
relays and a logic gate providing both a
hard stop and sub stop that can sever
all electricity immediately or shut down
all motors while preserving computer
power
our antenna includes a spring loaded
folding mechanism to meet weight in size
requirements
osiris 5 degree of freedom arm utilizes
two heavy duty linear actuators for
strong lifting capabilities
the tera azimuth rotation is a
hypocycloidal cage pinion and ring gear
mechanism that produces high torque with
zero backlash the turret is modular in
application and is reused on our science
mission our two axis end effector
actuates using a series of gear trains
and worm drive powered by three high
torque dc motors
providing both fine positioning and
gripping and heavy lifting capability
we designed a custom pcb integrating six
closed-loop motor controllers with power
and data provisions mosaics features a
rocker boogie suspension with a rear
mounted differential bar giving the
rovers stability over rough train
the limbs are square carbon fiber tubes
chosen for its high strength to weight
ratio
the front and back wheels are powered by
400 watt brushless dc motors using 100
to 1 gearboxes outputting 260 newton
meters of torque
the wheels are 3d printed thermoplastic
polyurethane 250 millimeter tires for
our motor drivers we are using dual
motor controllers with three phase hall
effect sensor feedback and integrated
pid control loops capable of up to 120
amps of continuous current our science
apparatus features a suite of different
tests to determine the presence of life
on different sites
the lowering platform mounted at the
front of the chassis carries multiple
non-intrusive sensors
using a combination of infrared
ultraviolet and optical imaging the
fluorescence and spectra reflected off
samples are studied for mineral
composition and signs of life
soil samples are vacuumed into a light
isolated testing chamber
after experiencing a chemical bath the
sensor measures the luminescence of the
atp in the soil samples
across the entire science package two
boards incorporate mosfet circuits to
control the soil collection mechanism
rotation of testing chambers
in the rock sampling process
for autonomy point clouds are generated
using a sterolabs z2i and leveraged on
an nvidia jetson agx xavier for gpu
accelerated computing
stereoscopic images are parsed for depth
points that deviate from an estimated
floor plan to detect objects in three
dimensions
detected objects and boundaries are then
used in an a-star search algorithm to
find the shortest path to a given gps
waypoint
autonomous motor control is facilitated
by issuing rotation speed values to a
ross to the service node
alvar attack detection is implemented
using opencv and it's built in our uco
module
each alvar tag has a hard-coded boolean
checkpoint indicating if said tag has
been found
frames with detected tags are
transmitted back to the base station for
verification
base station communications leveraged
ubiquity's two ac prism radio and air
max antenna on the 2.4 gigahertz radio
band excellent for nine line of sight
communication and high bandwidth data
streams
across this point-to-point network
control commands are sent downstream and
telemetry is sent upstream via nodes in
the rost2 interface
ros2's gui interface rqt is utilized for
control buttons for motors and cameras
and status signals process indicators
and video feeds to control the arm we
use a joystick to get precise pose
estimation for the joints of the arm a
warthog quality thrust master is used
for the drive control to enable manual
drive over the network and achieve
trajectory motion of the rotor
