ER Rover team a part of students
robotics Association which operates at
the faculty of power and Aeronautical
Engineering at Warsaw University of
Technology
[Music]
the Rover's components were designed and
made entirely by team members including
mechanical components electronics and
software
when constructing a robot we mainly
focus on its stability and modularity at
the front of the robot we placed a
universal rail that allows to quickly
Mount modules performing specific tasks
[Music]
a sixth degree of Freedom manipulator is
used for most of tasks
by using inverse kinematics the operator
can conveniently perform all necessary
operations
in addition the robust control
application is able to memorize current
manipulator positions this makes the
control partially automated and
simplified for the operator
foreign
has been adapted to lift objects
weighing up to 6 Kilograms
the power source is Lithium-ion
batteries which can last for more than
an hour of continuous operation of the
robot
[Music]
new updated desktop application software
a new platform software allows precise
control of the Rover
a control panel supports the Rover
operator
the panel includes screens displaying
Transmissions from analog cameras and
joysticks for controlling the Rover and
manipulator
operator communicates with the robot via
2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi an analog cameras
operating at 5.8 gigahertz
using rocker buggy suspension along with
bldc motors the Rover is able to
overcome difficult terrain obstacles
new body shell provides better Mass
distribution which also contributes to
enhanced stability of the Rover despite
introduced modifications we managed to
fit the requirements for the size and
weight of a robot
good off-road traction is provided by
Reliable Tires designed by our team
members
the wheels consist of polyurethane Foams
molded on 3D printed rims with aluminum
spokes
specialized bus was designed to enable
the various modules of the Rover to
communicate
this solution allows to encapsulate the
cables inside the body shell and provide
adequate heat dissipation
the modules are divided into those
controlling the drivers which collect
Elementary data and those responsible
for communication with the operator
[Music]
to maintain safety the platform is
equipped with an emergency stop switch
however if the connection with the Rover
is severed the Rover automatically stops
another module is the autonomy module
the autonomy was developed based on the
Robot Operating System oros platform and
gazebo
the main computer is supported by a
Jetson mini computer for calculations
our solution combines data from GPS
navigation IMU and stereoscopic Camera
all of these elements allows to detect
our talks avoid obstacles and plan the
optimal route to the destination
for science task a lightweight module
comprised of trust like frame was built
with aluminum profiles and 3D prints a
chemical apparatus was developed and
attached to the module
live detection will start with cellular
disintegration followed by mollusks and
non-hitrus tests for determination of
extinct life carbonates will be seeked
with hydrochloric acid
we think that our team and our Rover are
ready for the challenges ahead at URC
2023
we hope to see you in May foreign
