greetings from team roverx we're a group of 
passionate undergraduate students from the  
Vellore Institute of Technology Building Mars 
Rover prototypes our team is divided into six  
departments namely, electrical mechanical Cs 
and autonomous astrobiology and life sciences  
management and R&D we are elated to present 
our system acceptance review for this year's  
Rover 'Kronos' the mechanical Department focuses 
on designing manufacturing and assembling core  
subsystems of the Rover the drive system of the 
Rover is a double rocker suspension coupled to  
a modular space frame chassis consisting of 
v-slot links and aluminum tubes with the aim  
to improve accessibility and reduce weight the 
Rover is capable of traversing a wide range of  
terrain topographies such as Rocky Sandy muddy 
terrain with steep drops and harsh climbs the  
ground clearance has been increased to 
ensure that Rover doesn't collide with  
obstacles during traversal the double rocker 
system coupled with a bar differential helps  
to maintain the center of gravity and Achieve 
Mobility this configuration maintains proper  
weight distribution and ensure sufficient 
ground contact at all times a kill switch  
onboard the Rover instantly stops all 
the motion of the Rover ensuring safety  
for better precision and control during task a 
completely new robotic arm with six degrees of  
freedom has been designed and manufactured custom 
manufactured worm gears at all joints increased  
stability providing zero backlash with high 
reduction ratios each joint includes a motor  
with a high resolution encoded for accurate 
velocity and position control the end effector  
uses a worm gear to drive the fingers that are 
designed to carry out several tasks such as typing  
on a keyboard with a solenoid added to enable 
quick and accurate actuation of keys toggling  
switches plugging a USB stick and picking up loads 
up to 10 kg with a key installed to fasten screws  
our computer science team works on the core 
aspects of Rover's computation communication  
and control. For communication between the base 
station and the Rover we use a combination of  
a sector and omnidirection antenna which 
has non-line of sight range of 2 kilometer  
manipulation of the custom robotic arm manual 
navigation of the Rover and controlling the  
science of system is achieved by a combination 
of two game pads we retained our reliable core  
system and continue working on the autonomous 
system better feedback and control system we  
are focusing on each node separately to guarantee 
the repeatability of each function as of now we  
have completed the following milestones; creating 
waypoints and following GPS goals while avoiding  
obstacles smoothly a square spiral search pattern 
is used to find and locate ArUco tags and Rover  
follows transform to autonomously traverse to it 
successful arrival on a post or gate is marked  
by a green flashing LED we will continue building 
the recovery Behavior refining our autonomous  
navigation and optimizing the software after the 
SAR the electrical department works towards the  
Power Electronics drives and control Electronics 
of the Rover power to the Rovers provided by two  
24 volt Lithium Polymer batteries with a total run 
time of about 90 minutes power from the batteries  
is distributed through a custom power distribution 
board and a kill switch in combination with the  
relay is used to kill power in case of emergencies 
low-level processing motor control loops and their  
Associated feedback is handled by an stm32 F4 
microcontroller with code written in embedded C in  
a task oriented manner a debug port on the Rover 
uses St's Suite of monitoring software to debug  
the Rover in real time the science department 
primarily aims to develop and Implement suitable  
onboard experiments to determine the presence of 
extent extent or no life we use an auger and screw  
conveyer system to collect and distribute soil 
samples into a wet chemistry lab which caches  
and analyses the sample with minimal cross 
contamination reagent-based analysis consists  
of carefully optimized qualitative tests which 
detects the presence of important biosignatures  
in the soil we focus on essential inorganic and 
organic molecules which will indicate the presence  
of extinct or external Life by showing positive 
results in some form of visual indication a  
custom-made Raman spectrometer is used to perform 
the accurate compositional analysis of a given  
rock sample an NPK probe is used to analyze the 
soil sample for presence of nitrogen phosphorus  
and potassium which is used to determine the 
organic content soil quality and its capability  
to harbour life it also provides us with the soil 
PH moisture and temperature a digital microscope  
is used to determine the physical properties 
of a given sample and aids in the detection of  
micro fossils and microorganisms that might be 
present the weather monitoring station onboard  
the rover is equipped with a suit of sensors that 
measures the atmospheric composition of various  
gases of biological significance along with 
temperature pressure humidity and UV radiation  
the research and development department focuses 
on the long-term goals for the various subsystems  
of the Rover this year we are developing a custom 
can node for the robotic manipulator to ease the  
assembly and cabling of various electronics 
and introduce modularity and assistance for  
our future Rovers we are designing 3D printed 
wheels from TPU 95a material with a honeycomb  
structure lattice optimized for shock absorbance 
and reduction of weight we are actively working  
on the unit based approach for noise removal 
and building the data set for various rocks  
to optimize the inference of a Spectra obtained 
from the Raman spectrometer apart from working  
towards road development the team also believes 
in inspiring young minds towards space robotics  
through participating in technological events 
and conferences despite facing pandemic related  
setbacks last year and missing out on URC we 
have spent the past year preparing for this  
year's competition having gained valuable on-field 
experience during this year's International Rover  
challenge the team is now working on optimizing 
and testing the Rover for the upcoming URC 2023
thank you
