Team Rudra has been participating in the university rover challenge since 2013
Currently the team consists of 35 students from various engineering disciplines working on the intricacies of each system
This year the team has a special focus on incorporating new and innovative designs to tackle the URC problem statement
Attributing to the years of experience the team has established a fully functioning lab with state-of-the-art equipment
The rover has undergone a massive overhaul in each key area to achieve better performance on the field
for the extreme retrieval task
We have developed a four-wheel drive system with a differential mechanism which provides better stability to the chassis
This makes it adaptable to challenging terrain by keeping the system relative to the ground and wheels in contact for uninterrupted traction
The 24-volt high Torque DC motors transmit power through a bevel gear mechanism which diverts the load from the motor shaft to the bogey
This protects the motor shaft from stresses and safeguards the motor from excessive load
The astronaut assistance box is a hopper shaped tool bin with the sliding base actuated using a rack and pinion mechanism
for dropping tools
High discharge lipo batteries are coupled with an array of boost converters current sensors and relays to make the power system efficient
compact and fail safe
We are using products from ubiquity networks as our prime communication system
Operating at 2.4 gigahertz coupled with high gain antennas to provide a range of 2 kilometres for control
This range is optimized using antenna tracking algorithms to obtain maximum strength in communication. The robotic arm is the parallel four bar mechanism
operated by Electric linear and rotary actuators
The wrist engages 3 servo motors in a closed compact fashion
Designed meticulously to put minimum load on each of the motors
The designed orientation imparts six degrees of freedom to the arm
The gripper uses a DC motor through a Lead-screw mechanism for simple and effective operation
The arm is capable of performing tasks like turning screws and knobs flipping switches and opening drawers with ease
In addition to this the arm can lift and carry loads of up to 5 kgs
Custom PCBs are designed to make all connections plug and play and decreasing system's complexity
inverse kinematics is being used to achieve semi-autonomy in the ARM
The arm is capable of positioning itself to given three-dimensional coordinate which helps us perform the tasks with higher precision
IP cameras have been mounted for detailed view of each part of the rover during the task
The feed is transmitted using the 900 megahertz to 1.2 gigahertz frequency band
The coding domain of team Rudra has made great improvements since its inception in 2013
With every new challenge we have made advances in making the system better faster and more reliable
The rover now boasts an Nvidia jetson tx2 as the backbone of the system
It is used as a system master and carries out the major computation tasks for the rover like tennis ball detection for the autonomous leg
We are using robust Ethernet modules with UDP for inter communication within the rover over synchronous serial
communication protocols to put the system on a single unified network
The system is robust enough to switch between manual and autonomous mode using telemetry
For object detection in the autonomous task, we are using deep learning with tensorflow and OpenCV
The Nvidia jetson is connected to the rover mounted camera and is used to detect the tennis ball
It uses a single short detector as a convolutional model for the object detection
We have added a live stream feature which gives us an uninterrupted feed from a camera mounted on the rover via UDP connection
The rover also uses a GPS module with an inbuilt compass to navigate during the autonomous task
The control system for the rover features a clean intuitive and responsive GUI, which is used to monitor the rover traversing on the field
The aim of a mars mission is not only to detect life but also to distinguish between
extinct and extent life. The arm is equipped with 2 end-effectors, a
microscope and an auger for the examination of samples the auger drills the surface for the collection of soil and
Transfers it to the bio box enclosing a spectrometer setup for the chemical analysis to detect the presence of molecular biosignatures
For visual examination of rocks a live video feed from the microscope is used to identify various biogenic
morphological features
Which are signs of existence of endolithic life. In addition to these we use several
MQ series gas sensors to detect the levels of certain biomarker gases in the atmosphere
A custom GUI has been created to monitor all the data
