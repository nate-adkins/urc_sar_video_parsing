we are knr rover team a part of students
robotics association
knr which operates at the faculty of
power
and aeronautical engineering at warsaw
university of technology
while designing our rover we focused on
its modularity
special mounts enable us to quickly swap
the modules
to ensure full task compliance
in the rover we mostly utilize elements
designed and constructed by team members
from circuit boards to mechanical
components such as hull's aluminum
sheets or
suspension shafts we decided to revamp
the previously used rocker buggy
suspension
additionally we installed new more
powerful
and reliable drive modules coupled with
our own proven wheel design
the wheels consist of polyurethane foam
molded on 3d printed rims with aluminum
spokes
field tests have shown their unmatched
durability
as well as very good traction in all
conditions
owing to those new solutions our robot
is able to traverse demanding terrain
and overcome steep obstacles
[Music]
we also managed to keep the rover
compliant with the size
and weight requirements we designed a
power and communication rail with slots
for mobile platforms control units
to remove excess cables from the
interior and
in case of emergency allow for easy
repairs
we achieve around three hours of
operating time
and up to 10 kilometers of range on one
charge
we improved the functionality of certain
modules by modifying their software
thanks to the implementation of
automatic regulators
we achieved highly precise steering of
the rover
in order to provide safety of operation
mobile platform is fitted with an
emergency stop button
the rover will also automatically stop
after losing connection
2.4 gigahertz wi-fi provides
communication between the robot and the
operator
our new vision system consists of
digital cameras
as well as analog ones thanks to this
upgrade we achieved high redundancy of
the system
analog cameras provide low latency
stream
while the digital ones give us high
resolution video streams and over wifi
for our operator's convenience we
designed
a specialized control panel to allow for
precise steering of
each of the rover's modules in most
tasks
we utilize a 6 degree of freedom
manipulator
thanks to the implementation of inverse
kinematics
the operator can intuitively perform
desired movements
the gripper allows the rover to grab and
manipulate various objects
weighing up to 6 kilograms finite
element analyses
enable thus to account for large parses
acting on the assembly
when designing its components ability to
remember certain positions
is another feature added to the
manipulator's software that allows us to
quickly automate and perform some
repetitive tasks
[Music]
we have also designed a secondary
gripper which provides the manipulator
with the ability to extract a soil
sample and store it in the laboratory
module
we designed the science module to
prevent cross-contamination between the
samples
while performing the required
experiments
notable ones include a malicious test to
detect carbohydrates
as well as an hydrogen reaction to
detect amino acids
we also made sure neither the samples
nor the reagents
can spill outside the module
the last of the rover's modules is the
autonomy module
it consists of various sensors providing
data to a pc
which performs the calculations on board
the rover
by placing the autonomy computer on the
rover
we reduced the wi-fi load and eliminated
any delays caused by the transmission of
camera feed
and location data ar tag recognition
will be provided by one wide angle and
two narrow angle cameras
this solution will ensure detection of
the target from a large distance
we believe our rover is more than ready
to face the challenges of urc 2020
and hope to see you there in may
you
